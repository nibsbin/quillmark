//! Pre-scan of a card-yaml block's YAML payload to recover what the value parse
//! discards: comments and tags. One pass over the parser's event stream gives
//! each comment its container and slot, and each tag its node.
//!
//! Top-level comments become [`super::PayloadItem::Comment`]. Comments inside
//! block mappings and sequences are captured with their structural path and an
//! ordinal, which the emitter re-injects at (see [`NestedComment`]). A comment
//! inside a flow collection or a multi-line scalar belongs to the block entry
//! holding that value: its trailer, or an own-line comment after it.
//!
//! A mapping holding a merge (`<<`) reads its own keys, then each key the merge
//! brings that it does not already hold. Once it closes, its comments are placed
//! again among those keys: one ahead of, on or inside a merge sits with the
//! keys that merge brings.
//!
//! Every tagged node is recorded at its path in the value, for the assembler to
//! warn on; the value parse applies a core `!!` tag, ignores any other, and
//! keeps no tag.
