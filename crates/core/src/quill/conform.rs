//! Conform-on-load: the bound door that lands a document at its **canonical
//! rest**.
//!
//! A content field rests in its codec's lossless written form whenever the
//! quill resolved, the value commits under the strict write, and no
//! `!must_fill` marker rides anywhere in it: `richtext` as the canonical
//! content object, `plaintext` as its literal string
//! (`prose/canon/SCHEMAS.md` § "Content fields rest per codec"). Every
//! departure is a named state carrying a marker or a diagnostic, never a silent
//! second resting form.
//!
//! [`Quill::conform`] is the primitive and [`Quill::parse`] (parse, then
//! conform) the convenience: the documented primary ingestion path. The
//! schema-free [`Document::parse`] stays the transport/repair door (migrations,
//! `$ext` stamping, quill-unavailable fallback, opening-to-fix); its resting
//! form is unspecified.
//!
//! The walk is the typed write, driven by the schema instead of by a caller:
//! every declared content-bearing field goes through the same
//! [`resolve_field_write`] the typed writer commits through, so parse-then-conform
//! equals typed-write by construction rather than by parallel policy. What
//! differs is the failure posture: the writer refuses, conform leaves the value
//! authored and reports a `conform::*` warning.
//!
//! Four states are representable and none is silent:
//!
//! 1. **Quill unavailable**: the document loads through the transport door,
//!    fully readable and round-trippable, resting as authored.
//! 2. **Wrong quill**: [`Quill::conform`] errors before any mutation.
//! 3. **Non-conforming value**: rests as authored plus a `conform::*`
//!    diagnostic; the walk is stateless, so a repeat conform re-emits it.
//! 4. **Fill-marked**: rests as authored; the marker is the state.
