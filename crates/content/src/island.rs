//! Island types — the closed dispatch authority.
//!
//! [`Island::island_type`](crate::model::Island::island_type) stays an **open**
//! string on the wire: an unknown type (one this build lacks, arriving via
//! storage) round-trips opaque. [`KnownIslandType`] is that string's *parse* into
//! the closed set, and every site that dispatches on a type matches
//! [`KnownIslandType::parse`]. The `Some(k)` arm is exhaustive, so **adding a
//! variant is a compile error at every dispatch site**; a known type wired into
//! only some sites cannot reach the `None` path, which is the open set's alone.
//!
//! Behavior a type must supply lives on the enum, one method per seam (loss
//! class, cell marks, shape normalize/validate). The two projections that can't
//! live in this crate — markdown emit ([`crate::export`]) and Typst emit (the
//! typst backend) — match on the enum where they are, so the guarantee crosses
//! the crate boundary. The `table` codec stays in [`crate::serial`]; this module
//! dispatches into it.
