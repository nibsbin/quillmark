//! Markdown import (cold): `normalize → pulldown → content`.
//!
//! Input is normalized by `normalize::parse_markdown` (CRLF→LF, bidi
//! controls dropped, line separators spaced, then the parser-guided repair that
//! splits text off a comment's line, ends a table at a row of tags and sets a
//! line of carrier tags in an HTML block apart) so the content invariants hold
//! by construction, then
//! parsed with `pulldown_cmark` (CommonMark + strikethrough + pipe tables +
//! task lists, and footnotes recognized only to drop them) and
//! walked into a [`Content`]. This is the one place the `<u>`/`<br>` allowlist
//! runs, and the one place a dropped raw tag is counted into the
//! [`ImportWarning`]s an import returns beside its content.
//!
//! ## Canonicalizations
//!
//! - A line of carrier tags in a paragraph or a list item's text is a tag
//!   line: the break above it ends the text, and the text under it opens a
//!   paragraph.
//! - A soft break is a space and a hard break a `continues` line, distinct from
//!   a paragraph boundary. Inside a heading a hard break is a space, a heading
//!   being one line; a setext heading spans two source lines and can carry one.
//!   Inside a table cell a hard break is a `\n` in the cell's text. An inline
//!   `<br>` is a hard break, dropped where no text precedes it on its line.
//! - Two adjacent sibling containers keep their boundary, told apart by
//!   `Container::instance`, minted here and canonicalized by `normalize`.
//! - An empty heading, code block or container keeps its line. An empty
//!   paragraph drops, markdown having no syntax to write one back.
//! - Island ids are minted sequentially (`isl-0`, `isl-1`, …), so import is a
//!   deterministic function of its markdown. Export drops the ids and re-import
//!   re-mints the same sequence.
//! - Tables and images are islands, block and inline respectively; a thematic
//!   break is a `Rule` line carrying no text.
//! - A task list item's marker is its [`Container::ListItem::checked`]; `[X]`
//!   reads as `[x]`.
//! - A footnote definition drops whole, reported, and a reference to one is
//!   the text it is.
//! - Raw HTML produces no content beyond the allowlist and the carrier. An HTML
//!   block drops whole, as CommonMark runs it; one of tag lines alone passes
//!   its carrier tags on. A `qm-table` wrapper pairs as an element does,
//!   and folds its attributes into the props of the one table it wraps. A
//!   `qm-cell` pair around a table cell's whole content folds its attributes
//!   into the cell.
//! - A `qm-*` element the carrier does not reserve is modeled: a pair of tag
//!   lines wraps the blocks between them in a [`Container::Element`]. One left
//!   unclosed drops, what it wraps importing as written.
