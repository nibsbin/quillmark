//! `Content`: the canonical content model for Quillmark.
//!
//! One [`model::Content`] per content field: a single text sequence carrying
//! line attributes, anchored marks, and embedded islands, over one coordinate
//! space of Unicode scalar values. Markdown is a *projection*
//! ([`import::from_markdown`], [`export::to_markdown`]), so every edit is a
//! splice and all structure moves with it. [`serial`] is the canonical,
//! byte-deterministic JSON that storage, the render seam and the binding seam
//! all carry; [`delta`] and [`ops`] are the per-field edit surface.
