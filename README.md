Quillmark is a schema-driven document framework. You define a document format once, as a **quill**: a schema for its fields and a layout for its pages, either a Typst plate or an existing PDF form. Authors then write plain Markdown, and Quillmark validates each document against its quill and renders it to PDF, SVG, or PNG.

</p>

Both pages come from one Markdown file, rendered through the [`usaf_memo`](https://github.com/borb-sh/quillmark/tree/main/crates/fixtures/resources/quills/usaf_memo/0.2.0) quill. Its main card, abridged ([full file](https://github.com/borb-sh/quillmark/blob/main/docs/assets/gallery/memo.md)):

```markdown
~~~
$quill: usaf_memo
letterhead_title: NORTHWIND REGIONAL AUTHORITY
letterhead_seal: ""
memo_for:
  - ALL DIVISION CHIEFS
subject: Transition to the Records Portal (Suspense 15 Mar 26)
signature_block:
  - JANE Q. DOE
  - Chief, Records Management
date: 2026-02-02
~~~

The Records Portal replaces the shared drive for official records on 1 April 2026.
```

- **One implementation, four surfaces**: a Rust crate, a Python package, an npm package (WebAssembly, with a live canvas preview), and a CLI.
- **Two backends**: Typst typesets new pages; `acroform` fills the fields of an existing PDF form.
- **Written by people or by LLMs**: the schema emits a blueprint, an annotated Markdown form an LLM fills in, and validation reports diagnostics with machine-readable codes.

[Try it in the browser](https://borb-sh.github.io/quillmark-js/playground): edit a document and watch the page re-render.

## Status

Quillmark is pre-1.0, and its API changes between minor releases. Each breaking release ships a [migration guide](https://quillmark.dev/migrations/). A document saved as [versioned JSON](https://quillmark.dev/integration/persistence/) carries a version tag, and later releases migrate supported past versions forward on read.

## Documentation

- **[User Guide](https://quillmark.dev/)** - Tutorials, concepts, and bindings
- **[Rust API Reference](https://docs.rs/quillmark)** - Rust crate docs
- **[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** - Release notes and version history ([GitHub Releases](https://github.com/borb-sh/quillmark/releases))

## Installation

```bash
cargo add quillmark
```

## Quick Start (Rust)

```rust
use quillmark::{quill_from_path, CalendarDate, Engine, OutputFormat, RenderOptions};

// A `Quill` is declarative data: no engine needed to load it.
let quill = quill_from_path("path/to/quill")?;
let engine = Engine::new();

let markdown = r#"~~~
$quill: my_quill
$kind: main
title: Example
~~~

# Hello World
"#;

// Parse the Markdown and conform it to the quill's schema.
let doc = quill.parse(markdown)?.document;
// A render reads no clock: the host passes its local date.
let today: CalendarDate = "2026-03-14".parse()?;
let result = engine.render(
    &quill,
    &doc,
    today,
    &RenderOptions::default().with_output_format(OutputFormat::Pdf),
)?;

let pdf_bytes = &result.artifacts[0].bytes;
```

## Examples

```bash
cargo run --example usaf_memo
cargo run --example taro
```
