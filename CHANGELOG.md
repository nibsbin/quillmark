# Changelog

## v0.124.0 - 2026-10-10

Upgrade path: [0.123 → 0.124](docs/migrations/0.123-to-0.124.md).

### Elements

- feat(content,typst)!: **a `qm-<name>` element is stored content**, where its
  tags dropped. A pair of tag lines wraps the blocks between them and keeps its
  attributes as strings, and a line holding only `qm-*` tags is a tag line
  wherever it stands outside a heading, a mark or a link. Export writes each
  tag on its own line, and an element around nothing as its pair on one line.
  An element left open, self-closing or inside a line of text drops and warns
  `parse::dropped_construct` as `qm-<name>`. (#2096, #2141)
- feat(typst)!: **a Typst quill renders an element through the renderer its
  plate registers in the helper's `elements` state**, called `(attrs, body)`,
  and the built-in `keep` holds its run on one page. An element no renderer
  takes, `keep` aside, warns `typst::unregistered_element` at its field, and
  `quillmark validate` fails an `example.md` holding one. (#2096, #2140)
- feat(core,wasm)!: **the content types gain an element member**:
  `Container::Element` and `Invariant::BadElement` in Rust, and `{ container:
  "element" }` in WASM. (#2096)

### Tables

- feat(typst)!: **a `qm-table` wrapper lays out its table**: `widths` weights
  the columns, `align` places the table, and a bare `headless` draws the first
  row as a body row, with no `table.header`. (#2096, #2142)
- feat(content,typst)!: **a `qm-cell` pair around a table cell's whole content
  aligns that cell** through `align` and `valign`, and a stored cell's `align`
  or `valign` renders. (#2134, #2139)
- fix(content)!: **a `|` in a table cell's code span or link destination stays
  in its cell**; export escapes it, where it split the cell on re-import.
  (#2134)

### Task lists and footnotes

- feat(content,typst)!: **`- [ ]` and `- [x]` render a box**, ticked for
  `[x]`, and import as the list item's `checked`, where the brackets were text.
  A plate restyles the box through the helper's `tasks` state; `\[ ]` keeps the
  text. (#2135)
- feat(content)!: **a footnote definition drops with its note and warns
  `parse::dropped_construct` (`footnote`)**, where it silently defined a link.
  (#2135)

### Raw HTML

- feat(content)!: **a markdown import reports what it drops**: a raw tag, the
  block CommonMark runs it to, and a `<u>` left open each warn
  `parse::dropped_construct`, at the body or at a `richtext` field, and
  `quillmark validate` fails an `example.md` holding one. (#2096)
- fix(content)!: **an inline `<u>` pairs as HTML pairs it**, closing the
  innermost open `<u>` and never a `**`. (#2096)
- fix(content)!: **a fenced block holding `<!-- a --> b` keeps its line, text
  after a block nested in a tight list item opens its own line, and a line of
  tags after a table's rows ends the table.** (#2096)

### Whitespace

- fix(typst): **typed spaces keep their width on the page**: a line's leading
  spaces indent it, and a run of spaces inside a line, a mark's close between
  them included, is as wide as the spaces in it. (#2143, #2144)
- fix(content)!: **a paragraph whose first line holds only tags that drop opens
  without a leading space.** (#2141)

### Revise

- feat(core,wasm,python): **`reviseDocument` / `revise_document` replace a
  whole document with markdown and keep its comment anchors, island ids and
  `$ext` where they match**, and `toAnnotatedMarkdown` /
  `to_markdown_annotated` show where each anchor sits. (#2096)
- fix(content)!: **every revise keeps the island ids it can match**, and mints
  past the field's highest, where it re-minted each by position. (#2096, #2144)
- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **an import and a revise return their warnings**:
  `from_markdown` returns `Imported`, a revise `Revised { delta, warnings }`,
  and `addCard` / `add_card` a list of diagnostics. (#2096)
- fix(core): **a revise keeps the YAML comments nested in a field it
  revises.** (#2144)

### Validation and rendering

- feat(core)!: **`Quill::validate` warns `validation::declined_construct` at a
  field holding a construct the backend will not draw**, and the acroform
  backend warns `backend::declined_construct` at render. (#2096)
- fix(wasm,python)!: **a one-shot render carries the render's warnings
  alone**, not the document's parse and conform warnings. (#2096)
- fix(typst,cli)!: **`quillmark validate` reads `typst.plate_file` as a render
  does**, refusing it with the render's own `typst::plate_*` diagnostic. (#2096)

### Storage

- feat(core)!: **a save writes `quillmark/document@0.124.0`**, the first tag
  that holds an element or a task item's `checked`. Every older row loads as
  before; a 0.123 build refuses a 0.124 row. (#2135)

### Card YAML

- fix(core)!: **text after a card-yaml block's root value, and a mapping
  holding two keys of one text, fail the parse** at the offending line, where
  they dropped or overwrote. A tag inside a merge's value warns at the value's
  path. (#2096)
- fix(core): **the colon hint names the field whose `:` opens a mapping and
  quotes its suggested value.** (#2136, #2144)

### WASM

- fix(wasm)!: **a JSON `null` inside a returned value crosses as `null`**, where
  it crossed as `undefined`. (#2096)
- fix(wasm)!: **an options object inheriting a key its verb does not read from
  a null-prototype object throws `unknown key`**, and one whose read throws is
  refused with the handle left usable. (#2096)

### Base PDF reading

- fix(pdf)!: **a hybrid-xref base fails as `pdf::xref_stream`**, a `/Kids` that
  is no array of references and an unreadable annotation fail to parse, and a
  name compares through its `#xx` escapes. An `/Info` reached through a
  reference chain stamps. (#2096)


## v0.123.1 - 2026-10-06

Upgrade path: [0.123.0 → 0.123.1](docs/migrations/0.123.0-to-0.123.1.md).

### Table cells

- feat(content)!: **a table cell carries a line break**, one `\n` in its
  `text`, spelled `<br>` inside the pipe cell (`| line one<br>line two |`, any
  case, with attributes or a closing `/`) and typeset as `#linebreak()`. A
  mark spans the break as it spans a prose hard break, and its edge moves off
  it. `to_markdown` writes a cell's `\n` as `<br>`, and a `\n` in a cell
  written through the JSON lanes is a break, where normalization made it a
  space. `TableCell.text` is unchanged in shape. (#2071)
- feat(content)!: **an inline `<br>` is a hard break in a paragraph and a
  space in a heading**, where it rendered nothing, so a `richtext(inline)`
  value holding one now has two lines and fails as `validation::not_inline`
  (`edit::field_not_inline` on a strict write; a quill `default:` fails to
  load), and nothing else reports the change. A `<br>` with no text before it
  on its line, or alone on a line, still renders nothing; `\<br>` and a `<br>`
  in backticks stay literal. A `<br>` in an image's alt is a space, where it
  was dropped. (#2071)


## v0.123.0 - 2026-10-06

Upgrade path: [0.122 → 0.123](docs/migrations/0.122-to-0.123.md).

### Boolean coercion

- fix(core)!: **a number under a `boolean` field renders by whether it is
  non-zero**, a matrix member's bare tick included, so a float of magnitude at
  most `2.220446049250313e-16`, such as `1e-17`, renders `true` where it
  rendered `false`, and nothing reports the change. `0` and `-0.0` render
  `false`, and every integer reads as before. (#2053)

### Open matrix

- fix(core)!: **an open matrix's added item whose `title` is `""` or
  whitespace alone fails as `validation::enum_violation`** at its key, carrying
  the `open` hint, and the render with it, where it printed a held row with
  nothing beside the tick. Such an item in a `default:` fails to load as
  `quill::default_not_in_enum`, and in a card kind's `seed:` as
  `quill::seed_enum_violation`. (#2068)

### Comment placement

- fix(core)!: **a comment's text drops the whitespace ending its line**, read
  from markdown, a stored row or a `CardWire` alike, so `to_markdown` writes
  `# note` for `# note  ` and its emission reads back to the same document. A
  stored row holding such a comment rewrites once when saved again, and
  nothing reports the change. (#2064)
- fix(core)!: **a comment keeps the slot the YAML gives it** under a tagged
  empty value (`k: !!str`, `k: !`), inside an alias key's value, and around or
  inside a merge (`<<`), where `to_markdown` dropped or moved it, and nothing
  reports the change. A comment at a lesser column below a tagged or anchored
  empty value belongs to the collection around it. A top-level alias key keeps
  its place in the field order, where its field moved to the block's end, and
  a `parse::unsupported_yaml_tag` inside its value names the key's text. A
  sequence item emptied by its merges emits as `- {}` with its comment after
  it. (#2064)
- fix(core): **`to_markdown` indexes a field's comments once**, so emitting a
  commented container costs its entries plus its comments, not their product;
  the emitted markdown is byte-for-byte the same. (#2064)

### Base PDF reading

- fix(pdf,acroform)!: **a `form.pdf` whose page `/Annots` hold a widget
  annotation fails to open as `pdf::existing_acroform`**, naming the first
  page holding one, whatever its catalog `/AcroForm` holds, where a base whose
  `/AcroForm` was deleted or nulled stamped the fresh widgets beside its own.
  An annotation whose `/Subtype` references `/Widget` is a widget. (#2064)
- fix(pdf)!: **a trailer, catalog or page-tree node naming a key twice or
  with no value, or holding a token where a key belongs, fails as
  `pdf::parse`** (`pdf::stamp_parse` for the catalog under `stamp`), and an
  `/Info` object as `pdf::write`, where the stamp rewrote one entry of two or
  appended a key that took the next token as its value. A trailer's direct
  `/Info` dictionary of such a shape stamps a fresh `/Info` without its
  entries. (#2064)
- fix(pdf): **`%`, `{` and `}` end a token and NUL is white-space**, so
  `/AcroForm null%stripped` reads as `null` and stamps. A reference to a
  `null` object or to no object reads as absent, so `/AcroForm 7 0 R` over
  `7 0 obj null endobj` stamps where it failed as `pdf::existing_acroform`.
  (#2064)

### WASM options

- fix(wasm)!: **an options object, `Addr` or `CardInput` must be a plain
  object**, one whose prototype is `null` or `Object.prototype` of any realm:
  a class instance, `Object.create(defaults)` and a `Map` throw, where 0.122
  read a class instance's and an inherited key and none of a `Map`'s entries.
  A key the verb does not read throws when it is non-enumerable, such as the
  `__ob__` Vue 2 defines, or holds `undefined`, and so does a `new Engine`
  argument other than an object, `null` or `undefined`. Spread into a literal:
  `{ ...defaults, ...options }`. (#2064)

### Typst plate path

- fix(typst,cli): **a `plate_file` led by `./` names the file at the quill
  root**, so `plate_file: ./plate.typ` loads where it failed as
  `typst::plate_missing`, and `quillmark validate` accepts it where it refused
  it as `cli::plate_file_escapes_quill`. A leading `/` or a `..` step still
  misses, with a hint naming the spelling from the quill root. (#2064)
- fix(typst): the rooted-path hint on a `typst::file_not_found` states what the
  quill root holds, true of a bare path and a rooted one alike. (#2064)

### Parse hints

- fix(core): **an unquoted `.inf`, `.nan` or `1e999` hints its quoted
  spelling**, `s: ".inf"`, and the message drops serde-saphyr's option name;
  the parse still fails as `parse::yaml_error_with_location`. (#2064)
- fix(docs): card-yaml's "Quote these" table lists the number spellings a
  `string` field takes as a number: an `_` between digits, a `0x`, `0o` or
  `0b` prefix, an exponent, and the non-finite spellings that fail the parse.
  (#2064)


## v0.122.0 - 2026-10-05

Upgrade path: [0.121 → 0.122](docs/migrations/0.121-to-0.122.md).

### YAML booleans

- fix(core)!: **only `true` and `false`, in any letter case, are YAML
  booleans**, so an unquoted `y`, `n`, `yes`, `no`, `on` or `off` is the text
  written: `middle_initial: N` reaches the plate as `N` where it printed
  `false`, and nothing reports the change. A card-yaml payload, `Quill.yaml` and
  `QuillValue::from_yaml_str` share the reading. A word under a `boolean`,
  `number` or `integer` field, a matrix member's tick included, fails
  validation as `validation::type_mismatch` and the render as
  `validation::coercion_failed`; in `Quill.yaml` a word where a boolean belongs
  fails to load, and `values: [US, NO, DE]` loads. `!!bool` on a word fails the
  parse, its hint naming the two booleans. (#2034, #2044)

### Comment placement

- fix(core)!: **a comment keeps the slot the YAML gives it**: the prescan reads
  each comment's container and slot from the parser's event stream, so one in a
  sequence at its key's column, indented less than its block, in a compact
  nested sequence or trailing a plain scalar's continuation line re-emits
  there, where it moved or dropped. A sequence item carrying a trailer beside
  its first key's emits in the bare-dash form. `parse::unsupported_yaml_tag`
  warns on every tagged node at its own path. A column-zero key outside the
  field grammar fails as `parse::invalid_structure` naming the field, and so
  does a block whose comments and tags record more than 64 bytes of path per
  byte of the block, plus 64 KiB. (#2041)
- fix(core)!: **a legacy `quillmark/document@0.82.0` row's `$id` drops with its
  inline trailer**, which re-emitted on the item above. (#2041)
- fix(core): **a run of comments meets no count limit**, so a key's trailer
  ahead of 32 own-line comments parses, as does any longer run 0.121 refused.
  (#2044)
- fix(core): removing a `$seed` overlay keeps its siblings' order (#2041); a
  comment under an empty `$ext` or `$seed` survives `to_markdown`; and a
  top-level field named `null`, in any letter case, emits quoted, so the
  markdown reads back. (#2044)

### Checkbox appearance states

- fix(pdf,acroform)!: **every stamped checkbox carries both its appearance
  states**, `/AP << /N << /Yes … /Off … >> >>` with `/AS` and `/V` naming the
  current one, so a filler toggles it by renaming `/AS` and `/V`. A reader
  taking `/N` only as a stream draws an empty box, and rendered PDF bytes move
  wherever a checkbox is stamped. `StampOptions` gains `states:
  AppearanceStates`: `All`, the default, is the deliverable, and `Selected`
  writes each box's `/N` as the one stream `/AS` names, for a rasterizer that
  cannot resolve it, as the acroform canvas does. (#2038)
- fix(pdf): **a direct `null` dictionary entry reads as absent**, so a base
  PDF's `/AcroForm null` stamps where it failed as `pdf::existing_acroform`.
  Nulling the key strips no widgets. (#2038)
- fix(pdf): **a stamp appends to a page's `/Annots` without rewriting the
  array's bytes**, where it decoded them as lossy UTF-8, turning an inline
  annotation's Latin-1 byte into U+FFFD, and could land the new refs inside a
  closing `%` comment. (#2044)

### Typst plate path

- fix(typst)!: **a `plate_file` at a path Typst's path grammar refuses fails to
  open as `typst::plate_path_invalid`**, where the plate loaded as `main.typ`
  and shadowed the quill's own `main.typ`. Such a path holds a `\`: separate
  the path with `/`. (#2037)
- feat(typst): **a `typst::file_not_found` for a bare path in a module below the
  quill root hints the rooted spelling** when the quill root holds that file.
  (#2037)

### WASM options and types

- fix(wasm)!: **an options object refuses a key the verb does not read**:
  `engine.render` and `session.render` throw on a render option outside
  `format`, `ppi`, `pages` and `regions`, and `new Engine` on a key other than
  `backends`, so `engine.render(quill, doc, { today })` rejects, naming the
  trailing argument the date belongs in, where it rendered the local date. A
  null-prototype or cross-realm options object, `Addr` or `CardInput` is
  checked too. (#2036)
- fix(wasm)!: **`runtime.d.ts`'s writer and reader verbs type as declared**:
  `Addr`, `Content`, `Delta`, `PathStep` and `Resolved` read as `any`, so code
  leaning on the `any` stops compiling. (#2043)

### Load warnings

- fix(core,typst,cli)!: **a failed Typst compile carries the quill's load
  warnings after its errors**, so a thrown error's `diagnostics` may hold
  warnings; `diagnostics[0]` and the message are unchanged. `quillmark render`
  prints the carried warnings ahead of the error, and `quillmark validate`
  reports each once. (#2039)
- fix(typst,cli): **`quillmark workspace` prints the quill's load warnings**,
  which `Workspace.warnings` carries, and its `typst watch` command passes
  `--creation-timestamp=` at noon UTC of the render date, so the plate's
  `datetime.today()` agrees with the render's, before 1970 too. (#2039,
  #2044)

### Raster refusals

- fix(core,typst,acroform,wasm): **a raster refusal names a ppi or scale that
  fits**: a PNG export one that fits every selected page, pointing a page too
  long for PNG at PDF or SVG, and a canvas a scale. Both backends size a raster
  by `raster_size`, each side rounded and at least one pixel, so a tiny canvas
  scale paints one pixel where acroform threw, and `paint` checks a scale as
  the `f64` a JS number is before narrowing it. (#2040)
- feat(cli): **`quillmark render --ppi`** sets the PNG density. (#2040)

### Docs

- docs(quills): **consumer-study corrections** across the quill and authoring
  pages. (#2035)

### Build

- ci: `wasm-bindgen-cli` pinned to the lockfile's 0.2.129; thiserror 2.0.21,
  web-sys 0.3.106 and `taiki-e/install-action` 2.87.21. (#2032, #2033)


## v0.121.0 - 2026-09-30

Upgrade path: [0.120 → 0.121](docs/migrations/0.120-to-0.121.md).

### Matrix presence

- feat(core,typst,wasm)!: **a matrix member is held by being present in the
  document**: a mapping is held whatever it carries, `{}` included, and a bare
  scalar is the tick. A mapping naming no `held` flips from unticked to ticked,
  with nothing reporting it. `held` is never stored: a member mapping storing
  it fails validation as `validation::held_stored`, and the render with it, and
  a `Quill.yaml` `seed:` or `default:` storing it fails to load as
  `quill::seed_held_stored` / `quill::default_held_stored`. A `held: null` is
  absent. The strict write rests a held member with no answers as `true`, and
  the blueprint's `# e.g.` line drops `held: true`. (#2023)

### Matrix plate

- feat(core,typst,acroform)!: **a matrix reaches the plate as the members it
  holds**, each its columns keyed by id: no member carries `held` or a roster
  `title`, and an unheld member is absent, so a plate reading `m.held` or
  `m.title` fails to compile. `roster(dict, key)` in the Typst helper prints the
  whole vocabulary as `(id, title, held, value, path)` rows, and the dictionary
  declaring a matrix carries `$path` for it. A member's tick is its own address,
  `<field>.<member>`: a claim on `<field>.<member>.held` fails the compile, an
  acroform binding on it fails to load as `acroform::dangling_binding`, and a
  bare tick the boolean coercion refuses is `validation::type_mismatch` at the
  member's path. `resolve()` reports the members a matrix holds. A matrix takes
  a `default:` and `type: matrix?`. The transform schema carries the roster as
  `quillmark:roster` `[id, title]` pairs, and Rust `QUILLMARK_ORDER_KEY` is
  `QUILLMARK_ROSTER_KEY`; `FieldSchema::members` is `FieldSchema::member`,
  beside `added_item`, and `namespace_props` answers `None` for a matrix.
  (#2023)

### Open matrix

- feat(core,typst,wasm): **`open: true` on a matrix admits items a document
  adds**, each keyed by a snake_case id and carrying a `title`, taking the
  roster's columns. The plate and `roster` carry them after the held roster
  members, sorted by id, and an added item's `title` is a cell with an address.
  Any other key outside the roster is `validation::enum_violation`, which gains
  an `open` arg. The transform schema declares the added item as
  `additionalProperties`, `schema()` emits `open: true` (WASM
  `QuillFieldSchema.open`), and an acroform quill declaring one fails to load as
  `quill::open_matrix_unsupported`. `FieldType::Matrix` carries `open: bool`.
  (#2023)

### Release

- ci(release): **crate publishing retries past a crates.io index backlog**,
  excluding the crates crates.io already holds at the release version, so a
  re-run resumes a partial upload. (#2029)


## v0.120.0 - 2026-09-30

Upgrade path: [0.119 → 0.120](docs/migrations/0.119-to-0.120.md).

### `Engine.load`

- feat(wasm): **`engine.load(quill)` loads and instantiates a quill's backend
  build without a document**, cloning no quill. It is the memoized load
  `render` and `open` await, so a host can start the render build's fetch once
  the quill resolves and mount its editor on core meanwhile. Awaiting it before
  `open` makes the session's first compile read the current document. A failed
  load rejects, `runtime::backend_load_failed` for the built-ins, and the next
  call retries. (#2027)

### `quill::table_column_not_leaf`

- refactor(core)!: **a `ui.layout: table` column that is not a leaf fails to
  load as `quill::table_column_not_leaf`**, where it was
  `quill::table_column_not_flat`. Its trigger and message are unchanged.
  (#2021)

## v0.119.0 - 2026-09-30

### `ui.layout: flat`

- feat(core,wasm): **`ui.layout: flat` asks an editor to draw a typed
  dictionary without a frame of its own**, its properties standing at the
  depth of the field list around it. It is valid on any `object` but an array's
  element, and `quill::invalid_ui` anywhere else. The value, its addresses,
  the plate and the blueprint are unchanged. WASM `QuillFieldUi.layout` is
  `"table" | "flat"`. (#2019)

## v0.118.0 - 2026-09-30

Upgrade path: [0.117 → 0.118](docs/migrations/0.117-to-0.118.md).

### Kind seeds

- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **a card kind declares `seed:`**, what
  `seed_card` writes into a new card of that kind: the `$seed.<kind>` shape,
  fields plus an optional `$body`. `seed_document()` carries each kind's seed,
  and `schema()` emits it (WASM `QuillCardSchema.seed`). `CardSchema` gains a
  public `seed` field. A document's `$seed.<kind>` replaces the kind's seed
  whole, `$body` included, and `$seed.<kind>: {}` seeds nothing. A kind's
  seed is checked as the card it makes and fails the load under
  `quill::seed_*`, plus `quill::seed_redundant` for a seed that renders as the
  unanswered field does; `main` declares none (`quill::invalid_card_schema`).
  (#2016)

### Document `$seed`

- feat(core)!: **a document's `$seed` warns wherever the card it seeds
  would**: an undeclared key below a seeded field
  (`validation::unknown_field`), a cell outside its variant world
  (`validation::out_of_variant`), a `$body` that is not a markdown string or
  does not import (`validation::seed_overlay_shape`), and a seeded array past
  its `max:` (`validation::cardinality`). `quillmark validate` fails a quill
  whose `example.md` carries one. A `null` in `$seed.<kind>` commits nothing,
  where the new card carried `field:`. (#2016)
- refactor(cli): `quillmark validate` names `seed_document`'s output
  `seeded` in its render report, where it said `seed`. (#2014)


## v0.117.0 - 2026-09-29

Upgrade path: [0.116 → 0.117](docs/migrations/0.116-to-0.117.md).

### `example:` leaves the quill schema

- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **a `Quill.yaml` declaring `example:` fails to
  load.** A slot declares one value, its `default:`. `example:` on a field at
  any depth fails `quill::field_parse_error`, hinted to `description:`, and
  `body.example` fails `quill::invalid_body`. The `quill::example_*` checks
  and `quill::body_example_*` codes are deleted, and
  `quill::richtext_example_import` is `quill::richtext_default_import`. The
  blueprint drops its `# e.g.` and `# body e.g.` lines but a matrix's member
  hint, `schema()` carries no `example`, and `FieldSchema::example`,
  `BodyCardSchema::example`, WASM `QuillFieldSchema.example` and
  `QuillCardBody.example` are deleted. (#1999)

### The example document

- feat(core,cli,wasm,python)!: **`example.md` at the quill root is the
  quill's example**, a filled-in page whose values are made up.
  `Quill.yaml` declares nothing about it and the load never reads it.
  `Quill::example_document()`, WASM `Quill.exampleDocument()` and Python
  `Quill.example_document()` hand it out pinned to the quill's
  `name@version`, or `None` without one; a `$quill` other than the quill's
  bare name fails `quill::example_reference`. `quillmark` re-exports
  `EXAMPLE_FILE`. `quillmark validate` reads, validates and renders it, and
  fails the quill on any diagnostic it carries, a warning included
  (`cli::example_not_clean`, `cli::example_render_failed`): a quill keeping a
  root `example.md` for another purpose renames it. `status_report` and
  `usaf_memo` ship one. (#2002, #2007, #2009)

### Quill references

- refactor(core)!: **`$quill: name@latest` fails as
  `parse::invalid_quill_reference`.** It was a second spelling of the bare
  `name`, which matches the same versions. A selector is `MAJOR`,
  `MAJOR.MINOR` or `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, digits only, the grammar
  `@quillmark/quiver`'s `parseQuillRef` enforces. `VersionSelector::Latest`
  is `VersionSelector::Any`, and `QuillReference::latest` is deleted.
  (#2000)
- refactor(core)!: `VersionSelector` has no `Display`: `Any` has no written
  form outside a reference. `QuillReference`'s `Display` still writes `name`
  or `name@selector`. (#2008)

### Quill headers the load refuses

- fix(core)!: **`version: ""`, a tagged version such as `!!float 1.10`, and
  a card kind named `main` fail to load**, as `quill::invalid_version` and
  `quill::invalid_card_name`. None could hold what it seemed to. (#1994)
- fix(core)!: a `title` key on a matrix member in a document warns
  `validation::unknown_field` at `<field>.<member>.title`: the member's title
  is the quill's, and `quillmark check --strict` fails such a document.
  (#1994)

### Rendering

- fix(typst)!: **a quill shipping no fonts renders in Roboto**, where it
  rendered in Figtree, which has no prime: a `"` or `'` after a digit in
  richtext rendered as an empty box. The faces are variable Roboto, upright
  and italic, weights 100 to 900. A font-less quill's text reflows, a plate
  naming an unshipped `"Figtree"` warns `unknown font family`, and
  `quillmark workspace` exports `fonts/Roboto.ttf` and
  `fonts/Roboto-Italic.ttf`. (#2010)

### The CLI

- fix(cli): `quillmark check` locates a diagnostic in the file it came from,
  where every location read `input.md`; `quillmark` re-exports
  `DOCUMENT_FILE`. (#1995)
- fix(cli): a missing path given to `quillmark check` draws
  `cli::unreadable_document`, as an unreadable one does, where it stopped
  the run; the remaining paths are still checked. (#1994)

### Fixes

- fix(core): a field parse hint answers the key serde refused, at every
  depth. (#1999)

## v0.116.0 - 2026-09-26

Upgrade path: [0.115 → 0.116](docs/migrations/0.115-to-0.116.md).

### What blocks a render

- feat(core)!: **a card no kind claims, and a body under `body.enabled: false`,
  render and warn.** A render fails only where the engine would have to invent
  what the author wrote: a value that will not read as its declared cell's
  type, or markup the grammar cannot read. Input no declaration claims
  displaces nothing, so it renders and warns; SCHEMAS.md § "What blocks a
  render" sorts every validation code into incomplete, malformed and
  unclaimed. `validation::unknown_card` and `validation::body_disabled` are
  `Severity::Warning` from `Quill::validate`, `unknown_card` carries
  `allowed`, and an unclaimed card keeps its place in `$cards` with its
  fields verbatim. `ValidationError::UnknownCard` and `BodyDisabled` are
  deleted. This is the release's silent break: a pipeline that relied on the
  render failing catches nothing. (#1877)
- feat(core)!: **an undeclared key warns `validation::unknown_field`**, at
  every depth of a claimed card: a card field, a typed dictionary's property,
  an array element's, a matrix member's column, and a cell inside a variant
  container no world declares. `args` carry `suggestion`, the closest declared
  field the document leaves unwritten, or `container` and `variant` for a
  variant cell written beside its discriminant rather than under it. (#1871)
- feat(quillmark,cli)!: **a one-shot render carries validate's warnings.**
  `Quillmark::render`, WASM `engine.render` and Python `render` put every
  `Quill::validate` warning on the result's `warnings` ahead of the compile's,
  so the unclaimed input the page left out is on the result a pipeline reads.
  A session's warnings stay its current compile's. (#1931)
- feat(core)!: **a card-yaml block with no `$kind` fails the parse** as
  `parse::missing_kind`, located at its opener, with a hint naming both fixes:
  a `$kind:` line, or a backtick fence. Such a block was a card missing its
  kind line or tilde-fenced code, and reading it as either was a guess. Every
  card now carries `$kind`: `ResolvedCard.kind` is `String` (`string` in
  TypeScript), and a stored card with no `$kind` folds into the body above it
  on load, its payload as a code block, then its body. (#1905)
- feat(core)!: **a card-yaml payload that is not a mapping fails at its
  fence** as `parse::payload_not_mapping`, located at the opener, with `actual`
  and `info` args and a hint naming the backtick fence, where it was an
  unlocated `parse::invalid_structure` on a card and `parse::missing_quill` on
  the root. (#1873)

### `!must_fill` is removed

- refactor(core)!: **`!must_fill` and `validation::must_fill` are gone.** The
  marker said a cell held a placeholder rather than an answer, and the schema
  half of the warning read `default:`'s absence as an obligation. `default:`
  is the value an unanswered cell renders, `?` moves the render floor, and
  null ≡ absent holds on every surface. A value under the marker keeps its
  value: in markdown the tag drops as any unknown tag does, warned
  `parse::unsupported_yaml_tag` at the tagged node's rooted path (which that
  code now carries), and a stored row of any earlier tag is read past its
  `fill` keys. Deleted: `store_fill`,
  `is_fill`, the `QuillValue` fill set, `FieldSchema::{must_fill,
  example_content}`, `edit::fill_on_mapping`,
  `parse::fill_marker_unsupported_position`, WASM `storeFill` / `isFill`, and
  the card wire's `fill` / `nestedFills`. (#1906, #1933)
- refactor(core)!: **the storage tag is `quillmark/document@0.116.0`.** A
  field item carries no `fill` or `nested_fills`, and a row carrying either,
  or any key its type does not name at the document, card, payload or item
  level, fails the load, as does a nested comment spanning lines, which
  `to_markdown` would have written as bare YAML. Every earlier tag still
  reads. A row's bytes move on its next save, so content hashes
  recompute and a 0.115 build refuses the row from then on.
- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **a card-wire payload item refuses an unknown
  key.** A 0.115 integration still sending `{value, fill: true}` committed the
  placeholder as an answer, and an item typo vanished; `insertCard` throws and
  `insert_card` raises `ValueError` instead. (#1933)
- feat(core): **a `?` on a cell's type renders it `none` when unanswered**,
  so a plate can tell "0 votes against" from "nobody entered a tally". `?` and
  `default:` are exclusive (`quill::optional_default`), a namespace takes no
  `?` (`quill::optional_namespace`), and the transform schema projects
  `type: [t, "null"]`. (#1880)

### The blueprint and the seed

- feat(core)!: **seeding commits no `example:`.** An example documents a
  cell's shape rather than answering it, and `body.example` is guide text
  quills write as instructions. `seed_document`, `seed_main` and `seed_card`
  commit the `$seed` overlay alone; every other body is empty and every other
  field absent. (#1923)
- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **the blueprint answers nothing on the author's
  behalf.** A defaultless cell is empty (`title: # string`) with its
  `example:` on a `# e.g.` line above it; every body is empty, a
  `body.example` riding a `# body e.g.` line that closes the payload and a
  kind under `body.enabled: false` closing with `# no body`; a card's
  description rides its `$kind` line; a `default: []` table is led by the
  whole field commented out holding its row; and a matrix names its columns
  in an `# e.g.` line, a column with no example showing its
  `<type>[<format>]`. (#1874, #1942)
- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **`FORMAT_RULES` is `MARKDOWN_RULES`**, headed
  `Quillmark Markdown rules:` (`markdownRules` / `markdown_rules`), and keeps
  only what departs from plain Markdown and YAML. `blueprint_instruction` is
  deleted in every binding: a prompt is the consumer's to write. (#1942)
- feat(core)!: **`to_markdown` writes a multi-line string as a `|` literal
  block** (`|-` without a trailing newline), at every depth, where it wrote
  one double-quoted line. A string a block would not hold verbatim stays
  quoted. The value round-trips unchanged; the markdown bytes move. (#1883)

### The quill authoring contract

- feat(core)!: **a field's and a card kind's label is a top-level `title`**,
  beside `description`, which `schema()` emits and the blueprint prints as
  `# <title> — <description>`. `ui.title` fails the load, a `{field}` token
  in a `title` is `quill::title_template`, and a `title` on an array's `items`
  is `quill::title_on_items`. (#1922)
- refactor(core,wasm)!: **`body.unsupported` is removed**, with
  `plate::unsupported_construct`, `Quill::unsupported_constructs` and the WASM
  `QuillBlockConstruct`. Nothing verified a declaration against the plate and
  no editor read it; a `Quill.yaml` still declaring it fails
  `quill::invalid_body`.
- fix(core)!: **an unquoted `quill.version` reads as written**: `version:
  1.10` is `1.10`, where it loaded as `1.1`, and `1.1e1` fails
  `quill::invalid_version`.
- feat(core)!: **a `plaintext(inline)` value ending in a newline names `|-`
  as the fix.** `validation::not_inline`, `edit::field_not_inline` and
  `conform::field_not_inline` carry `trailingNewline: true`, and
  `ValidationError::NotInline` / `EditError::FieldNotInline` gain
  `trailing_newline`. (#1918)
- fix(core): `quill::invalid_name` suggests a name the loader accepts.

### The render date

- feat(core)!: **the host supplies the render date; a `date` field may hold
  `today`.** The engine reads no clock. `Quillmark::open` / `render`,
  `Quill::compile_data` / `compile_checked` / `resolve`,
  `QuillConfig::compile_data` / `compile_checked`, `TypedReader::resolve` and
  `Backend::open` take a required `today: CalendarDate`; a plate's
  `datetime.today()` returns it whatever its `offset:`. The CLI (`--today`)
  and the WASM and Python bindings default to the local date. A `date` value
  is `YYYY-MM-DD` or `today`, and the blueprint annotates `date<YYYY-MM-DD |
  today>`. `CalendarDate`'s parse fails with `ParseDateError`, which tells a
  day the calendar lacks from a string that is no date. (#1900, #1930)
- feat(fixtures)!: `usaf_memo`'s blank `date` renders a fill-in field where it
  rendered today's date.

### Plates and the Typst backend

- feat(typst)!: **a dictionary carries the `$ink` twin its fields print
  through.** A scalar printed off `data` kept its click target only as a
  direct read in the plate. `data`, each card, and each typed dictionary or
  table row carry `$ink` and `$path` wherever a field has ink: compute with the
  dictionary, print its ink (`ink(row).org`). A date's ink prints its default
  display, and `display(row, "due", "[year]")` formats one by dictionary and
  key. The keys are visible to `keys()`, `pairs()`, `len()`, `==` and a
  spread. (#1868)
- feat(typst)!: **a plate imports the quill's `.typ` files by Typst's path
  rules.** The plate loads at its `plate_file` path and every `.typ` file
  outside `packages/` beside it, so a bare path resolves from the importing
  file and a `/`-rooted one from the quill root. Plate diagnostics name the
  declared `plate_file`, where they named `main.typ`, and a vendored package's
  file under its spec (`@local/p:0.1.0/lib.typ`), apart from a quill module
  of the same path. (#1869)
- feat(typst): **a `typst:` key the backend does not read warns
  `typst::unknown_key`**, `typst.packages` included; a package is vendored
  under `packages/`, never fetched. A package manifest without `version` or
  `entrypoint` is skipped at load.
- refactor(typst): the `when` / `value-or` plate helpers are dropped; a plate
  reads an optional cell with `!= none`.
- fix(typst): a negative scalar's ink lexes, and region queries stay linear.

### Rendering, the CLI and the bindings

- feat(core)!: **one raster ceiling, 16384 px a side**, `MAX_RASTER_SIDE`,
  owned by core, where core refused past 16384² px of area and the WASM
  painter clamped by side on its own. A PNG export long on one axis that fit
  by area now fails `backend::invalid_raster_scale`.
- feat(wasm)!: **`paint(ctx, page, scale)` takes one scale and returns
  nothing**; `PaintOptions` and `PaintResult` are deleted, and a missing or
  non-finite scale throws `backend::invalid_raster_scale`.
- feat(cli): **`quillmark workspace` exports a plate for Typst's own
  tooling**: the generated helper for one document, every vendored package
  and the backend's fonts, with the `typst watch` command over them. A rerun
  replaces the `packages/` and `fonts/` an earlier export wrote. The facade
  re-exports it as `quillmark::typst_workspace`. (#1869)
- feat(cli): **`quillmark check` prints a document's every diagnostic**, and
  `--strict` exits `1` on a warning, for a CI gate over a repository of
  documents; `render` prints the warnings for what the page leaves out.
  (#1872)
- fix(cli)!: `render` takes its format from an `-o` extension naming one, and
  a `-f` the extension contradicts exits `1` before writing.
- feat(core,wasm,python): `Quill.emptyDocument()` / `Quill.empty_document()`
  reach the bindings, and WASM `isInline` / `isPlain` export the content
  predicates. (#1919)

### Fixes

- fix(core): the YAML prescan keeps comments, tags and anchors with the value
  they sit on across continuation lines, dash lines, block scalars, multi-line
  flow collections, a value below its key, nested keys with an inner `:` or a
  leading `-`/`?`, and a removed item's trailing comment; a `$seed` overlay edit keeps the comment on
  its `$seed` line.
- fix(core): `to_markdown` projects a content object at every depth of a
  field's value, and a container under a sequence item's first key
  round-trips.
- fix(core): a folded island past `isl-{u64::MAX}` mints a fresh id, and a
  folded card's `$ext` stays out of the body.
- fix(core): the unknown-key walk stays linear in a mapping's keys.
- fix(core): a `$seed.<kind>.$body` for a kind under `body.enabled: false`
  warns `validation::seed_unknown_field`, where the seed dropped it silently.
- fix(cli): `validate -v` reports a backend load warning once, where each of
  the three canonical renders repeated it.
- fix(quillmark): the facade re-exports `ParseDateError`.


## v0.115.0 - 2026-09-22

Upgrade path: [0.114 → 0.115](docs/migrations/0.114-to-0.115.md).

### The quill authoring contract

- feat(core)!: **a `matrix` member mapping takes the ordinary ladder.** Two
  rules decided what a stored member spelling meant — a bare scalar is the tick,
  and a mapping naming no `held` is held — and the second retires. A member is
  an `object` of a synthesized `held: {type: boolean, default: false}` beside
  its columns, so a mapping is the member object already and the tick it names
  no key for resolves as every other absent cell does, to its `default:`. The
  old rule overrode that ladder for one key in one type, and bought a spelling
  convenience for it: two mappings one key apart meant opposite ticks, the
  shorter one ticked, and any producer building the member object without
  conforming — an editor writing a column before the tick, a serde-built
  payload, `{}` — set a tick it never wrote. `{ detail: X }` is now unheld with
  its detail retained, which is what `{ held: false, detail: X }` already meant;
  the bare scalar and every mapping naming `held` are unchanged. What remains is
  exactly `conform_variant`'s bare-scalar rule, so `SCHEMAS.md` §Matrix lists
  three things as the type's own rather than four. The flip is silent — the
  value is well-typed under both readings, and a defaultless column's
  `validation::must_fill` leaves with the tick it was gated on — so the upgrade
  guide leads with it. (#1860)
- feat(core): **a typed dictionary's property opens a variant world.**
  `variants:` was card-level, so a conditional block had to sit at the top of a
  card even where the fields it governs belong to a dictionary. The rule was
  never about depth: what stays one level deep is the gap between a field's
  *declared* shape and its *live* one, and a dictionary's own shape is the
  schema's — so a world opened there deepens the address and leaves the gap
  alone. `header.classification` reads, binds, branches and strands exactly as
  `classification` does, one step down. Every other position would deepen the
  gap and still refuses one: an array element, whose liveness would vary per
  index against a form bound once; a matrix column, inside a grid the page
  prints in full; and another variant's cell, which would make the plate's one
  branch a tree. `quill::variant_placement` now names the position carrying the
  ban rather than restating the old rule, and the ban is **sticky** — an object
  inside any of them inherits it instead of laundering a world into a position
  that cannot hold one. The surfaces that dispatch on the container before
  walking the type needed nothing (coercion, validation, the render floor,
  conditional `must_fill`, the transform schema, `acroform` binding); the three
  that scanned card fields now descend, so `validation::out_of_variant` finds a
  strand at `main.header.classification.controlled_by`, the blueprint seats a
  world's cells — live or commented — at the dictionary's indent, and the seed
  resolves a nested discriminant before walking its field set.
- feat(core)!: **`ui.layout: table` contracts its columns.** The key was checked
  for its outer shape alone — `type: array` whose `items` is an `object` — so a
  row holding a container loaded clean and no editor could draw it: the author
  wrote a key, the loader took it, and a surface ignored it with no signal at
  either end. A column that is not a leaf is now
  `quill::table_column_not_flat`, naming the column (`appendices[].entries`)
  rather than the field. This splits the key along a seam it always had: a
  **contract** that every column is a leaf, settled at load, and a **request**
  to draw a grid, which an editor still declines for a width or a cell renderer
  it does not have. Shape leaves the decline list, since shape was never a
  consumer's judgement to make. The boundary is containment, not height — prose
  is a column whatever its `inline`, because how tall a cell renders is the
  editor's call and what it contains is not. `FieldType::is_leaf` is the one
  definition, an exhaustive match a new type cannot skip, and `acroform`'s
  `is_scalar_or_prose` is gone in favor of it: the same question had two
  answers in two crates. Part of #1859.
- feat(core,wasm,python): **the empty document has a constructor.**
  `Quill::empty_document()` is `Document::new` under the quill's own reference,
  so the three canonical documents are three constructors beside
  `QuillConfig::blueprint()` and `Quill::seed_document()`, and no caller spells
  `name@version` to reach the one a plate is bound to render. `quiver_test.rs`
  reads it rather than formatting the two-line markdown itself. The bindings
  carry it as `Quill.emptyDocument()` / `Quill.empty_document()`.
- feat(cli)!: **`quillmark validate` compiles the plate.** It renders the empty
  document, the blueprint and the seed through the quill's backend at the
  backend's first declared format, and reports each failure as a
  `cli::canonical_document_failed` error naming which of the three it is,
  followed by the backend's own diagnostics. The contract that a plate renders
  the empty document was checked for the fixtures quiver alone, and `render`
  with no input file renders the seed, the fullest of the three: a plate that
  reads a blank badly passed both. A quill whose plate does not compile now
  exits `1` where it exited `0`, and a backend that does not resolve is
  `cli::backend_unresolved` followed by the engine's own diagnostic. A render's
  warnings join the `-v` list, and `validate --no-render` is the configuration
  read on its own. Closes #1844.

### The content model

- refactor(content)!: **an island stores its value, not its provenance.** `Loss`
  had one minting rule — a table cell dropping an inline image's url — and no
  reader: export dispatches on an island's `type`, the Typst emitter and the
  acroform binder never looked, and an `islandOps` `set` stored whatever class
  the op named. Two cells written `| a cat |` and `| ![a cat](cat.png) |` mint
  equal `props` and differ only in the markdown behind them, which the
  projection has no syntax to carry back out, so the class survived neither a
  `to_markdown` → `from_markdown` hop nor re-derivation from the row holding it
  — which is why the content fixed point had to be stated modulo it. An
  island's canonical form is `{id, type, props}`, the fixed point is exact, and
  the closed vocabularies cover the four discriminators a projection dispatches
  on. `Loss`, `Island::loss`, `Island::with_loss`, `IslandType::default_loss`,
  `ContentIsland.loss` and `ContentLossClass` are deleted; a stored row spelling
  `loss` opens with the key ignored and absent from what comes back, and a
  `loss` on an authored island or an `islandOps` entry is ignored rather than
  refused. A host that surfaced the class surfaces the drop at the import
  instead, where the markdown it is about is still in hand. Closes #1757.
- refactor(content,core,wasm,python)!: **a block island's line is a `para`, and
  `LineKind::Island` is gone.** The kind was a second copy of a fact the island
  beside it already carried: markdown writes a `table` as a block and an `image`
  inline, so `IslandType::block_only` settled which line a lone slot sat on and
  `normalize` wrote that answer back over whatever was stored. Every read site
  now asks the island — export already dispatched on the type, the Typst emitter
  already lowered `Island` as `Para`, and the one fact the kind alone still
  answered, "this block renders one line", moves to the new public
  `Content::block_island_at`, which `normalize` reads beside
  `takes_continuations` when it clears a stranded `continues`. Landing a block
  island is two channels rather than three: the delta opens the line, the island
  op fills it, and the `setKind` goes. The TS `ContentLineKind` loses its
  `{ kind: "island" }` arm, so a host branching on it typechecks red; a `setKind`
  still naming `island` lands as the `para` it would have settled to.
- refactor(core)!: **the storage tag is `quillmark/document@0.115.0`.** The two
  lines above move canonical bytes — the `loss` key for every document holding
  an island, the line kind for every document holding a table — so content
  hashes recompute once on those rows. `DocumentV0_112_0` freezes with a raw
  `body` and the new `DocumentV0_115_0` carries the `CanonicalContent`; the hop
  between them is that body's decode, and `V0_93_0 → V0_112_0` becomes a retag
  now that both trees spell `body` raw. Stored rows need no migration: the
  content decoder reads `island` as `para` wherever it meets it, permanently,
  since the same spelling rests untagged inside every `richtext` field and
  `$seed` overlay, where no hop reaches it. Closes #1647.

### Schema, validation and the resolved view

- refactor(core)!: **a schema is loaded, not deserialized.** `QuillConfig`,
  `CardSchema` and `FieldSchema` serialize and no longer implement
  `Deserialize`, and `FieldSchema::from_quill_value` is crate-internal. A field
  arrives in two steps — the parse, which folds the sibling keys (`inline:`,
  `values:`, `members:`, `max:`) into the type payload, and the shape walk,
  which rejects an `object` without `properties`, an `array` without `items`,
  an empty `properties` map, and the placements — and only `parse_fields` ran
  both, so a config assembled through serde carried states no `Quill.yaml` can
  reach, absorbed downstream without a diagnostic. Gating the serde path
  instead would have duplicated the walk and collapsed its diagnostic codes
  into `quill::field_parse_error` at that boundary. The way to a config is
  `QuillConfig::from_yaml_with_warnings`, or a `Quill` read off a file tree;
  serialization is untouched, so `schema()`, `schema_yaml()` and every emission
  read the same loaded form they did. Closes #1836.
- refactor(core,wasm)!: **a matrix roster is one flat mapping; group headings
  are gone.** A block's `group:` was declared in the schema and absent from the
  value, the address and the vocabulary — the blueprint emits
  `matrix<a | b | c>` off one flat key space, so the partition reached the
  visual editor and nowhere else, buying one shared `properties` map for a
  schema concept, its load rules and a reserved key. `members:` is now
  `{id: Title}` directly, `MatrixGroup`, `MATRIX_GROUP_KEY` and the TypeScript
  `QuillMatrixGroup` are deleted, and `FieldType::Matrix` carries an
  `IndexMap<String, String>` read through the new `FieldType::matrix_roster`,
  which replaces `matrix_members`. The projection stops writing `group` onto
  every member, which returns `group` to the column names a quill may declare,
  and `quill::duplicate_matrix_member` retires: the roster is a mapping, so it
  has one slot per id exactly as the stored value does and a duplicate is
  unspellable on both sides. Closes #1851.

### The blueprint

- feat(core)!: **a dormant variant world is its own cells, commented out.** A
  variant-bearing enum's blueprint named every world it could not show, one
  `# when CUI: controlled_by, poc, category` line each — the one place on the
  surface where a cell was named rather than shown, dropping the position,
  obligation, type, description and example a cell carries. Every world now sits
  under a `# when <MEMBER>:` header in declaration order: the selected world's
  cells live, every other world's the same cells with a `# ` in front, at the
  slot they would occupy live. A reader activates a world by setting the
  discriminant and deleting `# `. One builder and one emitter serve both, so a
  dormant line is byte-for-byte the live line, and the block round-trips through
  `Document::parse` as the comments it is, reaching neither the validator nor
  the render floor. Closes #1846.


## v0.114.0 - 2026-09-18

### Schema, validation and the resolved view

- feat(core): **`type: matrix`: a closed vocabulary someone ticks.** A card kind
  gave add and remove, the wrong verbs for a roster the page prints in full, and
  an `array<{member: enum, detail}>` hid every unpicked option, let the same
  member in twice, and left the plate owning a second copy of the vocabulary to
  print the unheld boxes. A `matrix` declares `members:` — ordered blocks of
  `id: Title`, groups optional — and `properties:` as the columns, and the
  loader expands them into an `object` whose properties are the member ids, each
  carrying a synthesized `held: {type: boolean, default: false}` beside the
  columns. Coercion, validation, blank-fill and addressing are the typed
  dictionary's, reached through the new `FieldSchema::namespace_props`, so
  `qualifications.flight_cc.held` regions on Typst and binds a checkbox on
  acroform without a new address grammar. Four behaviors are the type's own.
  **Key presence is the tick**: `cyber_200: true` normalizes to the member
  object as the bare `classification: CUI` normalizes to `{value: CUI}`, and a
  mapping naming no `held` is held, so a document stays sparse. **The roster
  reaches the wire**: every member present in declaration order carrying its own
  `title` and `group`, so a plate prints the vocabulary without holding a second
  copy of it. **The wire carries the live world only**: an unheld member's
  columns render at their blanks whatever the document retains, the closed shape
  variants already hold, so tick, type, untick, retick keeps the answer in the
  file and stops rendering it. **Obligation is gated on the tick**: a column with
  no `default:` reads "required when held", the variant rule one level down,
  while the matrix itself obliges nothing, takes no `default:` or `example:`
  (`quill::{default,example}_on_namespace`, the existing namespace rule) and
  seeds empty. `held`, `title` and `group` are reserved as column names
  (`quill::matrix_reserved_column`); a member id is a snake_case identifier
  (`quill::invalid_matrix_member`), unique across the roster
  (`quill::duplicate_matrix_member`), and one outside it is refused as an
  out-of-domain enum member is. The blueprint spells the roster in the existing
  format slot, `# matrix<flight_cc | dodin_ops | …>`, over a `{}` cell, so no
  third annotation form is minted and a model sees the whole vocabulary without
  twenty-seven lines to delete. Closes #1831.
- feat(core): **the transform schema carries a declared key order, and the Typst
  codegen honours it.** `Codegen::emit_value` sorts dict keys so a reorder-only
  `update` rebuilds byte-identical `lib.typ` and comemo reuses the whole compile.
  A matrix is the one node that cannot pay it: printing the vocabulary as the
  schema groups it is the type's purpose, and sorted keys hand the plate
  `cyber_200` before `sq_cc_candidate`. A container node whose *schema* fixes an
  order now says so with `quillmark:order`, and the emitter reads it. The order
  is a property of the schema rather than of the data, so equal data still
  produces byte-equal source and nothing about the reuse changes; a node
  carrying no such key sorts as before.
- feat(core): **`max:` on an array, and `validation::cardinality`.** A form with
  thirty-seven ruled lines silently swallowed a thirty-eighth row, and the limit
  lived in `description:` prose that no consumer reads. `max:` is a non-negative
  integer on an `array`, refused elsewhere, and a `default:`/`example:` longer
  than it fails the load (`quill::{default,example}_over_max`) rather than
  seeding a document that warns on arrival. `Quill::validate` reports
  `validation::cardinality` at the field's own path with `{max, actual}`, at
  every depth — an array in a typed dictionary, a matrix member, a live variant
  world or another array's elements is capped by its own declaration — and never
  gates render: fatal ≡ won't-render is an invariant of the diagnostic model, and
  the plate keeps its own rule for the surplus. The count is the render floor's,
  so a bare scalar coerced to a one-element array is counted as one. `min:` is
  not taken: obligation is `default:`'s absence, so `min: 1` is `required:` under
  another name. Closes #1826.
- feat(core): **the blueprint carries a cap as `# up to <N>`.** The author most
  likely to exceed a limit is the MCP flow that reads the spec once and then
  writes, and it reads the blueprint: `schema()` is consulted before that author
  writes, and the `validate` warning arrives after the overflowing document
  exists. The line rides the own-line leading slot directly under the field's
  description, the form `# composable (0..N)` already takes for a card kind's
  cardinality, so the `<type>[<format>]` inline grammar is untouched. It reaches
  a field and an `object` property, the two positions that slot exists at.
- feat(core): **`ui.layout: table` asks an editor for the grid a typed table
  wants.** A row of four short cells drew as a stack of collapsed rows that open
  one at a time — the right control for a row of long prose, the wrong one here —
  and `UiFieldSchema` is `deny_unknown_fields`, so the shape had no way to ask.
  `layout: table` is valid on an `array` whose `items` is an `object` and refused
  with `quill::invalid_ui` anywhere else, and `schema()` echoes it verbatim. A
  request, not a contract: the plate, `validate` and the blueprint are all
  deliberately inert on it, and a consumer that cannot draw the control falls
  back to its own choice for the type. `items.ui.title` is documented beside it
  as the collapsed row's summary template, which needed no loader change.
  Closes #1825.
- feat(core): **a card kind declaring `body.enabled: false` warns.** A card is a
  part someone writes; a repeated record someone fills in is a row, an
  `array<object>` on the card that owns it. Four card kinds across three airmark
  quills were rows in card costume, each bodiless with a plate reassembling them
  from the stream by position. `quill::bodiless_card_kind` says so at
  `Severity::Warning`, hinting at the row shape. A warning and not a load error,
  because the loader sees the proxy and not the fact: whether a kind interleaves
  among kinds of other sorts is a property of documents and the plate, nothing in
  `Quill.yaml` states it, and a bodiless positional kind — a page break, a rule,
  an inserted signature block — is a card. `main` keeps the key unwarned: a form
  has no root prose. Closes #1824.

### The binding surface

- feat(wasm): **`formatDiagnostic` renders a diagnostic as the CLI does.**
  `Document.formatDiagnostic` left the binding in 0.113 among the five owner
  calls a host can make itself, and it was the one of the five that left a
  surface behind: Python keeps the rendering on `PyDiagnostic.__str__`, which is
  `fmt_pretty`, and the CLI prints through the same call, so WASM alone lost the
  engine's English. A consumer wording its own still selects by `code` + `args`.

### Docs and tests

- docs(core): **`ERROR.md` § "Error Presentation" names the two lanes apart.** A
  consumer surfacing the engine's wording calls the one printer; a consumer
  wording its own selects by `code` + `args` and owns the layout with the
  sentence.
- docs(acroform): **the worked example gains the richtext field the fixture
  does.** `sample_form` is what the backend guide points at for a hand-authored
  `form.pdf` + `form.json`, so its excerpts state what that fixture declares.
- test(core): **one fixture walk, one scalar-fidelity home, one card-order
  test.** Closes #1676.
- test(core): **one loader, one coercion table, one quill header.** Closes #1677.
- test(pdf,typst): **one base-PDF builder, one home per invariant.** Closes
  #1681, closes #1680.
- ci: **the release dispatches the docs deploy it no longer triggers.**
  `docs.yml` deploys Pages on `release: published`, and moving `gh release
  create` onto `GITHUB_TOKEN` stopped that event starting a run, so the site sat
  eleven releases behind at v0.102.0. `workflow_dispatch` is the one event exempt
  from that rule, which `release-prepare.yml` already leans on for `ci.yml`, so
  the release dispatches `docs.yml` at the tag it just pushed — the site is built
  from the released bytes, and a prerelease is skipped as the event path skipped
  it.
- build(deps): **lopdf 0.44.0 → 0.45.0**, and **taiki-e/install-action 2.87.8 →
  2.87.12** in the actions group.

## v0.113.0 - 2026-09-16

Upgrade path: [0.112 → 0.113](docs/migrations/0.112-to-0.113.md).

### The content model

- fix(content): **a marker run that spells a thematic break breaks its line.**
  Three nested empty bullet items emitted `- - - `, which CommonMark reads as a
  thematic break rather than as three items, so the nesting was gone after one
  pass; `> + + +` and any deeper run went the same way. Changing a bullet char is
  the obvious way out and is not available — a different char starts a new list,
  resetting `ordinal` on that item and every one after it, and the empty item can
  share its list with a non-empty sibling. The item's content moves to the next
  line instead (`-\n  - - `), which no marker char and no list identity depends
  on. The check runs per level, so a run of any depth breaks into pieces of at
  most two, and a line that never spelled a break emits the same bytes as before.
  `delimiter_run()` takes `+` back, the token it was denied to keep this defect
  from making that property flap. Closes #1809.
- fix(content): **the projection's safety net verifies the marks a rendering
  carries, not only its text.** `to_markdown` took the first spelling whose
  emission re-imported with the text intact, and an ambiguous `***` run costs the
  text in one shape and only the marks in another: `**a±**_b_**c**` lowered to
  `**a±***b***c**`, which CommonMark re-segments into one `Strong` over all three
  spans. Every character came back, so the net passed it — and bold moved onto
  the `±b` the source did not bold, two spans became one, and the second emission
  differed from the first. That last part is
  `the_markdown_loop_settles_on_an_arbitrary_body` going red on main. The probe
  now compares the re-imported marks against the ones the sweep was asked to
  carry, and the whole search is keyed on that one predicate — the four spellings
  first, then the drop-by-halves — so a rendering is taken only where it
  re-imports as the content it rendered. Text is still the floor the search
  cannot go below, `**`/`*` is still swept first, and a line that already
  round-tripped emits the same bytes. Over 20M generated delimiter runs the
  emissions needing a second pass to settle fall from 17 to 0, and the marks
  that come back over text they did not cover fall with them, 17 to 0. Closes
  #1807.
- fix(content): **a mark whose delimiters collide with its neighbour's is
  re-spelled, not dropped.** `to_markdown` spelled `Strong` `**` and `Emph` `*`
  and nothing else, so a `Strong` ending in a literal `*` against an `Emph`
  starting where it ends emitted a `***` run CommonMark re-segments rather than
  pairs; the verify-and-drop net read the text drift that caused and dropped the
  `Strong` to recover the text. `__a**__*b*` imported as `a**b` under
  `Strong(0..3) Emph(3..4)` and exported as `a\*\**b*`, losing bold the round
  trip was meant to carry, and `~~*a*~~` lost its `Emph` whenever the sweep put
  `*` outside `~~`, where it has no non-punctuation to pair against. Markdown
  spells both kinds a second way: the net now tries `__`/`_` before it drops
  anything, and the asterisk family sorts innermost among marks over one span.
  Every candidate is verified exactly as before, and `**`/`*` still leads, so a
  line that already round-tripped emits the same bytes. Over 200k generated
  delimiter runs the marks lost across export∘import fall from 104 to 14, the
  remainder being the crossing tails `clip_asterisk_overlap` truncates by
  design. Text was never at risk and does not move. Found reviewing #1801.
- fix(content): **`Delta::map_pos` saturates its base cursor.** `mapPos` is the
  one `Delta` door no `try_apply` bounds, and it summed a wire delta's
  `retain`/`delete` counts with a plain `+`: on wasm32, where `usize` is
  32-bit, `{ops:[{retain:3000000000},{retain:3000000000}]}` wrapped to a wrong
  caret position in the published build and aborted the instance in the
  checked one. `map_pos`, `is_deleted` and `inserted_spans` now walk the ops
  with `saturating_add`, as `expected_base_len` already did: a run past
  `usize::MAX` describes a base longer than any content, and a position lands
  inside it as it would in a bounded one. Closes #1782.
- refactor(content,wasm,python)!: **one canonical content form, a zero
  `Container.instance` omitted.** Canonical JSON had two byte forms differing
  only in whether a zero `instance` was written: storage omitted it, so a row
  written before the field existed re-encodes byte for byte, and a second
  encoder spelled it on every container so the published `ContentContainer`
  type could require the field. Required bought no correctness — a checker
  reports an omitted field, never the `0` stamped on two runs that welds them,
  which is what `assignInstances` is for — and it cost a spelling a host had to
  tell apart from the one storage holds. `serial::to_seam_value` goes;
  `to_canonical_value` is the one encoder, and every `Content`-typed read
  answers in it: `getContent{,At}`, `getStored` on a body, `importMarkdown`,
  `rebase`, and the `Card` wire. TypeScript spells `instance?: number` on both
  arms, and an absent key decodes to `0` as the spelled one did, so every write
  takes either spelling and no stored byte moves. A host reading the key off a
  read finds `undefined` where it found `0`: the break no type checker reports.
  `emit`'s markdown projection of a content-valued field now matches one form
  rather than two, so a value carrying a spelled zero stays a structural
  mapping until it is conformed. Closes #1648.
- feat(content,wasm)!: **the content vocabularies close.** A line `kind`,
  container, mark `type`, island `type` or `loss` outside the built-ins was an
  open set: it round-tripped opaque and projected as its nearest safe
  neighbour. All five are closed, so a name outside them is
  `ParseError::UnknownName { axis, name }` at every decoder and a stored row
  holding one stops opening. Projecting an unknown `kind` as `para` would
  re-encode the row and move canonical bytes on a read with no edit, which is
  why refusing is the only honest reading. No first-party writer ever produced
  another name, so the affected population is exactly the rows a host authored
  one into through `overwrite`, `applyChange` or a card body. The mark axis
  closes inside a table island's cells too, where the read is otherwise lenient
  — `canon_cell` re-mints from what `parse_cell` returned, so a skipped name
  would leave stored bytes behind on a read with no edit. A *malformed* cell
  mark is still skipped; that split is about shape, not vocabulary. The three
  `Unknown` carriers, `RESERVED_*` and the three `ReservedUnknown*` invariants
  go; `Island::island_type` becomes the `IslandType` enum and `Loss` becomes
  the enum `Fidelity` was. On the WASM surface the six unions lose their open
  arm, so `line.kind === 'heading'` narrows `line.attrs` with no guard, and the
  eleven content guards (`isTableIsland`, `isImageIsland`, `isLinkMark`,
  `isAnchorMark`, `isHeadingLine`, `isCodeLine`, `isListItemContainer` and the
  four `isUnknown*`) are deleted — each was one discriminant check the
  narrowing now performs. The storage tag is unchanged: every byte the writer
  emits is the same, and only the reader's accepted domain narrowed. Adding a
  construct is a storage-version event from here on. Closes #1693.
- refactor(content,wasm)!: **`Content::normalize` settles the lenient/strict
  split alone.** Eleven `Invariant` arms named shapes the mint repairs — a
  zero-width or newline-edged formatting mark, a `continues` flag on the first
  line, across a container boundary or after a one-line block, a line kind its
  text contradicts, the four table shapes, and a block island's slot sharing
  its line — and every door mints before it validates, so each fired only on a
  hand-built content. All of it goes: `validate` reports what normalization
  cannot repair (a forbidden character with no substitute, two counts with no
  rule saying which is right, a range or depth past a bound, a colliding id),
  and `setKind` / `setContinues` land with the terminal normalize settling them
  — a contradicted kind becomes `para`, an impossible `continues` clears, line
  0 included. So `applyChange` resolves where it threw, and `Ok` stops meaning
  the op landed as written: an editor mirroring ops into its own model reads
  the content back. The one content-changing case is a heading retagged
  `island` or `rule`, which is a paragraph afterward. `BadHeadingLevel` and the
  block-island placement stay refused — the first has no principled rewrite,
  the second is the authored lane's policy rather than a second reading of a
  repair. `LineKindMismatch` leaves the crate, and so do
  `ApplyError::LineKindMismatch`, `ContinuesAcrossContainers`,
  `ContinuesSingleLineBlock` and `FirstLineContinues`;
  `LineKind::takes_continuations` names the kinds a continuation is legal after
  (`Para`, `Code`, `Unknown`), since export renders only the first line of a
  heading, island or rule. Stored bytes are untouched, and the one reader
  change is a loosening: a blob spelling `continues: true` on line 0 loads
  cleared where it failed. Closes #1699.
- feat(content)!: **a block-only island takes a line of its own in the model,
  not only on the way out.** A `table`'s markdown is a block, so a slot spliced
  into a paragraph exported as pipes mid-line — `a| h |\n| --- |\n| c |b` — and
  re-imported as prose with the island gone. `Content::normalize` performs the
  break the export used to perform at write time, so the model can no longer
  hold a shape markdown cannot spell. `IslandOp::Insert` refuses an `at` that
  is not an empty line, `IslandOp::Set` refuses retyping an inline island into
  a block-only one (`ApplyError::BlockIslandNotAlone`), and `overwrite` refuses
  the same placement through `serial::from_authored_value`. Storage stays
  lenient: a stored blob in that shape loads already split with its marks
  rebased, and `to_markdown` writes a paragraph, the table, and a paragraph, so
  the island survives re-import. An accepted `LineOp::Join` that runs a slot
  back into its prose is taken apart again by the mint. `normalize_markdown`
  narrows to `pub(crate)`.
- fix(content)!: **a link or image `url` carrying a line ending is refused
  where it is authored, and percent-encoded where it is written.** CommonMark
  admits no line ending in a destination, bare or angle-wrapped, so `"a\nb"`
  exported as `[t](<a\nb>)`, which pulldown reads as an inline HTML tag: the
  re-import came back `[t]()` with the mark gone, and an image the same way
  with its island gone. An authored lane that *stores* a url now refuses one —
  `MarkOp::Add` of a `link`, `IslandOp::Insert` and `IslandOp::Set` of an
  `image`, and the whole-content doors (`overwrite`, `CardInput.body`) — the
  way an unwritable code-fence `lang` is refused. `MarkOp::Remove` still takes
  it, matching on kind equality against a mark the field already holds. Storage
  stays lenient, and `to_markdown` writes the line ending as `%0A`/`%0D`.
- fix(content): **an island alone on a line takes the line kind its type
  projects.** An `image` slot alone on a `LineKind::Island` line and the same
  slot on a `Para` line both wrote `![alt](url)`, which re-imports as `Para`,
  and a `table` alone on a `Para` line wrote a pipe table, which re-imports as
  `Island`: two normalized contents per document and one markdown, so any write
  and read back flipped the kind. `IslandType::block_only` names which markup
  is a block, and `normalize` writes the kind the round trip yields.
- fix(content): **VT, FF, NEL, U+2028 and U+2029 in document text become a
  space.** Typst's lexer reads all five as line breaks, so one mid-paragraph
  reopens `at_start` and the characters behind it are read as a block marker —
  `"intro\u{c}- item"` rendered a bullet — and two in a row split the
  paragraph. No escape reaches them, a `\` before whitespace being Typst's own
  linebreak. The spaced set is Typst's whole newline set less `\n`, named by
  `normalize::is_line_separator`, refused by `validate`, and replaced at every
  text ingress: `from_plaintext`, markdown import, an `Op::Insert` through
  `apply_text_delta`, and a table cell's text. A space rather than a drop, both
  being Unicode whitespace, so the words either side stay parted. Markdown-spec
  §7 states it.
- fix(content): **a paragraph emptied by HTML stripping leaves no line.**
  `<span></span>` on its own imported as an empty `Para` line, which markdown
  has no syntax to write, so `to_markdown` emitted a stray blank line and
  re-import collapsed it. An empty heading, code block and container keep their
  line, markdown being able to write those back.
- fix(content): **a code span whose content touches its fence exports with the
  CommonMark space pad.** Export emitted `fence + content + fence`, so an edge
  backtick joined the fence run (text `` `a `` came back as ` ```a`` `) and a
  span that begins and ends with a space lost one off each side on re-import. A
  pad space now flanks the content in exactly those two cases, which import
  strips back off; a span of nothing but spaces is exempt from the strip.
- fix(content): **a mark flanking an unknown island's placeholder survives
  export.** The verify-and-drop net re-imports the rendered line and expects
  the line's own text back, island slot included, but a type this build has no
  projection for renders as a comment placeholder that re-imports as nothing —
  so the probe could never match and every `**` / `*` / `~~` on such a line was
  dropped as unrepresentable. The expected text now omits the slots of islands
  with no markdown projection, so the probe measures delimiter leakage alone.
- fix(content): **`diff_import` carries unknown marks forward beside anchors.**
  The rebase loop matched `MarkKind::Anchor` alone, so a full-document rewrite
  through the stale-text writer lane dropped every open-set mark, even one over
  text the rewrite left untouched. It rebases every non-formatting mark —
  formatting is what the fresh import re-derives, and the rest lives in the
  content but not in markdown.
- fix(content): **a change bundle whose `retain`/`delete` counts sum past
  `usize` is a base mismatch, not a panic.** `Delta::expected_base_len` summed
  the counts unchecked, so `{"retain": 18446744073709551615}` aborted in debug
  and wrapped in release, where the wrapped total let `apply` slice past the
  base. The sum saturates past any real base, so `try_apply` and
  `apply_field_change` return the `DeltaBaseMismatch` the contract already
  names.
- fix(content): **`change_bundle_from_value` reads camelCase keys only.** The
  snake_case fallback served a Python content lane that does not exist.

### Parsing and the card block

- feat(core)!: **`---` front matter is CommonMark's, and the message names the
  fence to write instead.** A `---` at document start paired with a later `---`
  opened the root block. It is a thematic break and a setext underline again,
  so a document fenced that way has no root block and fails `MissingQuill`. The
  alias was accept-don't-emit-don't-advertise: no authoring page taught it,
  `FORMAT_RULES` says the fence is exactly `~~~`, the blueprint emits `~~~`,
  and `toMarkdown` rewrote a `---`-authored root to `~~~` on first re-emit.
  What it cost was a rule that only half held — composable cards have no `---`
  form — and the containment that took: a document-start rule, a matched-fences
  rule, and a lookahead rejecting a `---` below the root block when a later
  `---` paired with it over YAML-key-looking content. That lookahead read prose
  it had no claim on. A thematic break, a paragraph opening `Note:`, and a
  second break is ordinary markdown, and it was refused outright with a
  composable-card error. The scanner now reads no `---` at all, so it claims
  nothing a CommonMark renderer draws, and `missing_block_message` carries what
  the tolerance was for: a document opening with `---` and declaring `$quill`
  is told to replace the opening and closing `---` with `~~~`, which is the
  edit. A `---` document *without* `$quill` keeps the generic message, which
  names the fence and the key together rather than sending the author back for
  a second turn. Refs #1698.
- feat(core)!: **every column-zero `~~~` block is a card, whatever its info
  string.** The opener's info string is no longer read. `~~~card-yaml` and
  `~~~yaml` were accepted aliases and `~~~rust` opened an ordinary code block;
  all of them open a card now. The spec already stated the widened rule in §3.2
  and then exempted language info strings in the next sentence, so a tilde
  escape hatch was half-promised and half-withheld — and already unavailable
  for the two shapes anyone would reach for: a YAML block, claimed by the
  `yaml` alias, and a nested backtick block, written with a bare `~~~`. Nothing
  first-party emits a language-tagged tilde fence. A backtick fence is the
  escape hatch, and the whole of it. The widening deletes what the exemption
  needed: the accepted-alias list, the `RootFault::InfoString` diagnostic that
  explained why `~~~metadata` opened no block, and `code_fence_info`, whose
  last caller it was; `RootFault` collapses to the `UnclosedRoot` struct it now
  is. CommonMark conformance is unchanged — `fence_conformance_tests` holds
  every card block to a pulldown-cmark fenced span at the same offsets — so the
  widening moves toward equality rather than away. The `body.example` blueprint
  guard tightens with the parser it delegates to. `docs/cli/reference.md` and
  `prose/canon/CLI.md` stop naming an alternative opener. Refs #1698.
- fix(core)!: **`main:` parses under the same strict card-schema shape as a
  card kind.** A `main:` that is not a mapping, an unknown key under it
  (`feilds:`, `title:`), and a `main.fields` that is not a mapping all loaded
  as a main card with zero fields and no diagnostic; each is now
  `quill::invalid_card_schema`. `main` and `card_kinds.<name>` accept
  `description`, `fields`, `ui` and `body` only, and a malformed `ui` or `body`
  block under either reports `quill::invalid_ui` or `quill::invalid_body` with
  the hint naming that block's keys, where a card kind drew the whole-card
  refusal.
- fix(core)!: **the §8 count caps report a count, not a byte size.** The
  card-count and per-block field-count caps raised `parse::input_too_large`,
  whose one message shape is `Input too large: {size} bytes (max: {max}
  bytes)`, so 1001 fields read as 1001 bytes. Each cap has its own variant and
  code: `ParseError::TooManyFields` / `parse::too_many_fields` and
  `ParseError::TooManyCards` / `parse::too_many_cards`, both carrying `count`
  and `max`. `parse::input_too_large` keeps the two byte caps.
- change(core)!: **YAML nesting depth is the parser's to bound, and
  `MAX_YAML_DEPTH` is gone.** The constant set `serde_saphyr`'s depth budget
  and doubled as the bound on host values crossing into the document, so one
  number spoke for two unrelated limits. YAML parsing runs on `serde_saphyr`'s
  own budget, and the write surfaces (`store_field`, `store_ext`, the wire and
  storage DTOs, the bindings' converters) bound values at `MAX_JSON_DEPTH`
  (128), the depth storage already accepts — raising the accepted depth on
  those paths from 100. `§8 Limits` no longer fixes a YAML nesting number.
- refactor(core)!: **prescan's cleaned YAML is line-for-line with its source.**
  A comment line was dropped from the string handed to the parser, so the two
  numberings diverged and a `PreScan::source_lines` table existed to map a
  reported position back. The line passes through — it is a comment to the
  parser too — and the table, the `Cleaned` pair it rode in, and the
  fall-back-to-the-last-line lookup go with it. Blanking the line instead is
  what this does *not* do: a blank line is content under keep chomping, so
  `bio: |+` followed by a comment would have gained a newline. One break: a
  comment indented inside a multi-line plain scalar now ends it, as it does in
  YAML, so `key: aaa` / `  # c` / `  bbb` raises a located `parse::yaml_error`
  where it used to fold to `"aaa bbb"` — a value no YAML parser reads out of
  that document.
- refactor(core)!: **nested comments hang off the payload, not each item.**
  `PayloadItem::Field` / `Meta` lose `nested_comments`; one list on `Payload`
  carries them, at paths whose head segment names the owning entry. That is the
  form prescan already produced and the storage DTO already stored, so the flat
  → per-item → flat conversion at both ends is gone. `Payload` gains the public
  `nested_comments()` and `rename_field`, which carries a field's comments with
  its key; `items_mut` is withdrawn, having existed only for the rename that
  now has a verb. The wire is untouched: `PayloadV0_92_0.nested_comments` was
  already the flat sidecar.
- fix(core): **an unclosed root `~~~` block is reported as unclosed.** A
  document that opens with `~~~` and `$quill` but never closes the fence drew
  the generic `parse::missing_quill` text, telling the author to open a block
  they had already opened while the scanner's unclosed-fence signal was
  dropped. The message names the opener's line, the field to close after, and —
  for a `~~` run or an indented `~~~` — the line that failed to close it.
- fix(core)!: **a card-yaml parse failure carries a document `Location`.**
  `YamlErrorWithLocation` keeps the engine's line and column, translated
  through the comment lines prescan drops and the leading whitespace `trim`
  removes onto the document's own coordinates, and `to_diagnostic()` sets them
  as the `Location` (`input.md`). The message names the block (`YAML error in
  the root card-yaml block: …`) in place of the block-relative `at line N
  (block K)` prefix, and `args` no longer carries `line`.
- fix(core): **a card fence with CRLF line endings parses as its LF twin
  does.** The prescan splits the fence body on `\n`, so every CRLF line reached
  the matchers with a trailing `\r`: a bare `x: !must_fill` matched neither
  spelling the fill-tag stripper accepts, so the marker was read as an unknown
  tag — dropped with two warnings, a `null` value and an `x: null` emit — and a
  lone `-` opening a sequence item was not one. The scan strips one trailing
  `\r` per line up front.
- fix(core): **`key: !must_fill` written inside a block scalar or a quoted
  scalar is that scalar's text, and warns about nothing.** The
  `parse::fill_marker_unsupported_position` check re-read every cleaned line
  after the prescan, block-scalar bodies among them, and accepted any `:` plus
  whitespace as the tag's left boundary. The prescan decides the warning per
  line as it reads one, where a block-scalar body and a quoted value are known
  for what they are; the four positions the marker genuinely cannot survive
  still warn.
- fix(core): **a `!must_fill` marker nested inside `$seed` or `$ext` warns
  instead of vanishing.** A `$` metadata value is a plain tree with no fill
  carrier, so a marker under one reached neither storage nor emit and the cell
  it marked read back as `null`. Parse emits a
  `parse::fill_marker_unsupported_position` warning naming the cell
  (`$seed.note.from`). The value under the marker is kept; a marker on the `$`
  key itself remains a parse error.
- fix(core): **a field name is ASCII as written, not as it normalises.**
  `is_valid_field_name` ran NFC before matching `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, so
  `store_field("\u{212A}elvin", …)` was accepted, emitted verbatim, and re-read
  as a nested key: the document did not survive `parse(to_markdown())`. The
  check reads the name's own characters, matching the raw bytes the parser's
  key grammar accepts.
- fix(core): **a new `$` entry lands after the preceding `$` line's inline
  comment, not between the line and its comment.** `Payload::upsert_meta`
  inserted one past the last lower-ranked `$` item, which is the index the
  trailing comment occupies, so `$quill: q@1.0 # note` with no explicit `$kind`
  emitted `$kind: main # note`. The four callers now leave the trailer on its
  own key and `parse(to_markdown())` holds.
- fix(core): **a comment between a bare `-` and the item's first key stays
  inside the item.** The prescan records such a comment against the item, but
  emit wrote it above the `- ` line, where it re-parses as a comment on the
  sequence — a parse-emit-parse inequality settling only on the second emit. A
  sequence item whose mapping carries an own-line comment before its first key
  emits in the bare-dash form, so the first emit is the fixed point. A
  blueprint's typed-table row takes that form too.
- fix(core): **a field write clears a root `!must_fill` bit riding on the value
  it is handed.** The payload item's own `fill` flag is the one carrier of a
  root marker — emit, the wire and the storage DTO all read it there — while
  `QuillValue::set_fill_at(&[])` marks the value tree's root, and a value
  stored after that call kept both bits. `Payload` clears the tree's root bit
  on insert, so a document compares equal to itself across the markdown and
  storage round trips. Parse skips a nested-fill path naming only its own key,
  the route reaching the same split from source.
- fix(core): **`Card::store_fields` refuses a `!must_fill` marker targeting a
  mapping, as `Card::store_field` does.** The batch checked the field-name
  grammar and value depth only, so a marker on a nested object node was stored,
  emitted with the marker dropped, and refused by the `@0.92.0` storage DTO on
  reload. `edit::validate_fill_targets` runs per field in the same
  all-or-nothing pass, so the offending name rides the batch's error vector as
  `edit::fill_on_mapping`. The WASM `storeFields` inherits it.
- fix(core): **a `ParseError` spells its English once.** `to_diagnostic()`
  renders the variant's `Display` instead of a second copy of the same
  sentence, and the copies had drifted: `InvalidStructure` displayed under an
  `Invalid YAML structure: ` prefix the diagnostic dropped. A Rust caller
  formatting `{err}` from `Document::parse` reads that variant without the
  prefix, matching what every binding and the CLI have always shown.
- fix(core): **body prose left inside a card block is told to close the block,
  not to wrap itself in a block scalar.** A closing `~~~` placed after the
  prose body fails YAML on the first prose line, and `simple key expected`
  answered every such line with the wrapped-scalar advice: rewriting the memo
  as `body: |` keeps the body inside the block and fails again. The hint reads
  the flagged line the parser names and names the real fix — close the block
  before the prose. A genuine plain scalar wrapped onto a second line keeps the
  block-scalar hint.
- fix(core): **a leading space before a top-level key gets its own hint.** One
  stray space folds the line into the preceding plain scalar, and YAML raises
  the same `mapping values are not allowed` an unquoted `:` inside a value
  raises — so the hint sent the reader hunting for a colon that is not in the
  block, and four models quoted the `subject:` above it instead. Where the
  flagged line starts with a space, reads as `key:` or `key: value`, and
  follows a column-zero key line, the hint names the space.

### The binding surface

- refactor(core,typst,wasm,python)!: **a diagnostic carries its cause in the
  message.** `Diagnostic::source_chain` and the `with_source` builder that
  filled it are gone, and with them JS `Diagnostic.sourceChain` and Python
  `Diagnostic.source_chain`. One code ever filled the field:
  `typst::world_creation`, whose boxed cause is a `String` whose `source()` is
  `None`, so the chain was a one-element array holding the text its own message
  already ends with — and `skip_serializing_if` omitted the field from every
  other diagnostic. No formatter read it: `fmt_pretty` covers severity, message,
  code, location and hint, so the CLI's output and Python's `str(diagnostic)`
  are byte-identical. A Rust caller attaching a cause interpolates it into the
  message, which is what `RenderError::coded` already does at the one call site.
  Refs #1748.
- build(wasm): **three artifacts to two: the `render` build carries both
  backends.** The core split (no engine, ~0.5 MB) is real for a web editor and
  stays guarded. A pdfform-only binary bought "a pdfform-only page skips 8 MB
  of Typst", and no such page exists; the render artifact grows by the
  `quillmark-pdfform` crate and a brotli decoder, `hayro` already shipping in
  it under `typst-render`. The wasm `typst` and `pdfform` features collapse
  into one `render` feature — a feature named for one backend that selects two
  would be a fresh inaccuracy in place of the one #1749 records — and the
  forty-three `#[cfg(any(feature = "typst", feature = "pdfform"))]` sites
  become `#[cfg(feature = "render")]`. `build-wasm.sh` emits `pkg/core/` and
  `pkg/render/`; `runtime.js` keeps one `DEFAULT_BACKENDS` entry per backend
  id, each with its own `formats` manifest, sharing one memoized load, and the
  `Engine` keys its module, engine and clone caches on the descriptor's `load`
  thunk rather than the backend id, so two ids over one build hold one entry
  each. Both drift guards stay, the pdfform one retargeted at the merged
  build. Closes #1640.
- feat(core)!: **`reader.get` answers in the values form, and `ReadValue` is
  gone.** `get` returns the plain value: every content leaf in the field's type
  tree as its codec's text (`richtext` markdown, `plaintext` literal),
  descending `items` / `properties` / `variants`, so `reader.get("paragraphs")`
  is `["Para **one**", …]` where an `array<richtext>` used to return the stored
  content objects. A present-null reads `null` rather than `""`. A leaf that
  does not decode raises `edit::field_decode` anchored at the element
  (`main.paragraphs[1]`). A read never coerces: `qty: "3"` reads `"3"` here and
  `3` only in `resolve`. `reader.getContent` and `reader.getContentAt` are
  unchanged, and are where a leaf's anchors and island ids read back: the text
  form carries neither.
- feat(bindings)!: **the storage DTO verbs name their lane, not their
  encoding.** `Document.toJson` / `fromJson` / `loadJson` become `toStored` /
  `fromStored` / `loadStored`, and Python's `to_json` / `from_json` become
  `to_stored` / `from_stored`. `storageVersionOf` and `currentStorageVersion`
  are unchanged, already naming storage. "Stored" is the at-rest form
  throughout, so the pair completes the family `getStored` started; the bare
  `store` stays the field-write lane's verb. The old names are removed rather
  than aliased. Stored blobs, the `schema` tag, and every byte these verbs
  write are untouched.
- feat(bindings)!: **`resolve` lives on the reader.** `quill.resolve(doc)`
  becomes `quill.reader(doc).resolve()`: a verb that needs a schema lives on
  the cursor. WASM-only, as before.
- refactor(core,wasm,python,cli)!: **`Quill.metadata` loses the
  `<backend>_<key>` mirror, and `quillmark info` loses `--json`.** A loaded
  quill carried four identity fields verbatim plus every key under the backend
  section flattened as `<backend>_<key>`, so `typst: { plate_file: plate.typ }`
  surfaced as a `typst_plate_file` entry. Nothing read a mirrored key: the
  Typst backend and the CLI read `QuillConfig::backend_config`, and both
  bindings built their identity keys from the config and used the map only for
  the leftovers. `quill.metadata` (JS and Python) carries exactly `name`,
  `version`, `backend`, `author`, `description`, in that order — so a metadata
  snapshot serializes stably across processes, where the extras rode core's
  `HashMap` iteration order. In Rust, `Quill::metadata` and
  `quillmark_core::STANDARD_METADATA_KEYS` are deleted. The `--json` flag's one
  distinctive output was that mirror.
- refactor(wasm,python)!: **five owner calls leave both bindings.** Each is a
  call the host makes itself in a line or two from surface that stays:
  `Document.tryFromJson` / `try_from_json` — never renamed with its lane, and
  deleted rather than aliased, so `storageVersionOf(b) ? fromStored(b) : null`
  is the read — `Document.makeCard` / `make_card` (a `CardInput`
  object literal), `doc.setCardKind` / `set_card_kind` (`removeCard` +
  `insertCard` at the same index),
  `result.renderTimeMs` / `render_time_ms` (clock the call), and
  `Document.formatDiagnostic` (the CLI and Python's `str(diagnostic)` still
  render it). They go from **both** surfaces, so WASM remains the reference
  surface Python mirrors.
- refactor(wasm)!: **a foreign handle on a by-reference method is a bare
  `Error`, and `runtime::foreign_handle` retires.** The prototype patches on
  `Document.equals`, `Quill.validate` and `Quill.conform` are gone with the
  `Symbol.for('@quillmark/wasm:handle-checked')` marker they needed:
  wasm-bindgen's own `_assertClass` already refuses a foreign class wherever a
  method declares a reference parameter, and it throws a bare `Error`, so
  `isQuillmarkError` reads `false` there. The seams that cross as **data** keep
  their check, nothing else catching them: the four writer/reader binds, every
  `Engine` verb, and `LiveSession.update`. A value that is not one of this
  copy's handles is `runtime::not_a_quill` / `runtime::not_a_document`, whose
  hint names both cures including `npm ls @quillmark/wasm`. A consumer routing
  on `runtime::foreign_handle` routes on the two `not_a_*` codes instead.
- refactor(python)!: **`Writer` / `Reader` take a `card=` selector.**
  `writer.card(i)` and `reader.card(i)` returned a cursor holding the index;
  the index is a keyword on the verb, `None` selecting the main card.
  `CardWriter` and `CardReader` go with the cursors.
- refactor(core,wasm,python)!: **the `$ext` namespace verbs collapse into the
  whole-map three.** `storeExtNamespace` / `removeExtNamespace` /
  `getExtNamespace`, the Python pair, and the `Card::*` methods they delegated
  to are deleted. `getExt` / `storeExt` / `removeExt` keep the whole surface,
  `card` selector included: `$ext` is a map the engine never inspects, so a
  namespace write is `{...getExt(addr), [ns]: v}` on the client and the read
  shape is the write shape. The one behavior the spread does not carry is the
  drop-when-empty — `removeExtNamespace` dropped `$ext` with its last namespace
  where `storeExt({})` records an explicit `$ext: {}` — for which `removeExt`
  is the call. Stored bytes, the Markdown round trip and the plate strip are
  untouched.
- fix(core,wasm,python)!: **a card built from a wire refuses under the code its
  addressed mutator mints.** `insertCard` folded a malformed field name, a bad
  `$quill` reference, a `!must_fill` on a mapping and a malformed item list
  into one code-less refusal, so `diagnostics[0].code` was `undefined` in JS
  and Python raised a bare `ValueError` — while `storeField` / `setQuillRef`
  carried `edit::invalid_field_name`, `parse::invalid_quill_reference` and
  `edit::fill_on_mapping` for the same violations. `WireError` carries the
  `EditError` its addressed twin raises and both bindings stamp
  `WireError::code()` on the diagnostic. A card dict Python cannot read as a
  card at all is still a `ValueError`; one that deserializes and then violates
  an invariant is a `QuillmarkError` under its code. The list-level violations
  (a duplicate key, a field count past the §8 bound, a `$` entry twice, a
  comment spanning lines) carry the new `edit::invalid_payload`.
- fix(python)!: **every `edit::*` diagnostic anchors at the `DocPath` its verb
  ran against.** `Diagnostic.path` had two spellings for one refusal:
  `writer.set` minted none and `writer.set_all` the bare field name. The
  converters thread the base anchor the WASM binding does, so an undeclared
  name is `main.stray` from every main-card verb, `cards.<kind>[<i>].stray`
  from a card cursor, and a structural out-of-range op is `cards[<i>]`. A
  consumer comparing against a bare field name now matches nothing.
- fix(python)!: **a negative index is an out-of-range index, not an
  `OverflowError`.** Every index parameter was a `usize`, so `doc.card(-1)`,
  `doc.move_card(-1, 0)` and `render(pages=[-1])` died in the boundary
  conversion with a third exception type, outside the two the binding
  documents. Indices are signed at the boundary. A negative one addresses
  nothing — it is not the last card, and the binding does not index from the
  end — so it takes the answer its site already gives an index past the end:
  `edit::index_out_of_range`, `backend::page_index_out_of_bounds`, or `None`
  where `remove_card` answers absence.
- fix(python): **`OutputFormat` and `Severity` members are hashable.** The two
  pyclass mirrors declared `eq` alone, which fills `tp_richcompare` and leaves
  no `tp_hash`, so CPython stamped `__hash__ = None` and every variant was
  rejected as a set member or a dict key. Both are frozen and hash by variant.
- fix(python): **a card dict is `CardWire`'s serde projection rather than a
  hand copy of it.** `card_to_pydict` serializes the wire and adapts the two
  keys Python's surface owns: snake_case `payload_items`, and an explicit
  `None` where an absent `$quill` / `$ext` / `$seed` leaves the wire key out.
  Every key and value is what it was; the dict iterates in the wire's own
  order.
- perf(python): **reading `RenderResult.artifacts` copies no bytes.** The
  getter rebuilt its list on every read, cloning each artifact's buffer, and
  `Artifact.bytes` cloned that again, so a `save` followed by one `bytes` read
  moved a multi-MB PDF three times. The `Artifact` and `Diagnostic` objects are
  built once, with the result; `bytes` makes the one Rust→Python copy and
  `save` writes without one.
- fix(wasm): **a failed conversion at the typed boundary throws instead of
  stranding the JS handle.** `RenderOptions`, `RenderResult`, `Diagnostic`,
  `ChangeSet`, `ContentHit` and `FieldRegion` cross as `tsify::Ts<T>`, whose
  handle the wasm-bindgen shim owns and frees; the deprecated `into_wasm_abi` /
  `from_wasm_abi` impls they carried leaked it on the way out (tsify#65), and
  took the module down with a trap rather than a catchable error when
  serialization failed. The TypeScript surface is byte-identical, and the crate
  compiles warning-free.
- fix(wasm): **an unregistered backend rejects with `engine::backend_not_found`
  like every other failure.** The four `Engine` verbs threw a bare `Error` for
  a quill whose declared `backend:` has no loader, so `isQuillmarkError`
  answered `false` and the README's own `catch` example re-threw it as a
  foreign failure. The rejection carries one diagnostic under the code core and
  the Python binding already raise, hinting the registered backend ids.
- fix(wasm): **`Engine.render` returns the document's load warnings ahead of
  the compile's own.** The engine renders a backend-memory clone built by
  `Document.fromStored`, which carries no warnings, so a parse, `conform::*` or
  `plate::unsupported_construct` diagnostic reached `RenderResult.warnings`
  from no public surface. `Engine.render` snapshots `doc.warnings` beside the
  storage DTO and fronts the result with it, the pipeline order ERROR.md
  states. `LiveSession.render` carries the compile half alone.
- fix(wasm)!: **a `MarkOp` spells its payload where the decoder reads it, off
  one `ContentMarkKind`.** The `link` and `anchor` arms declared it as a named
  sibling — `{ type: "link"; url }` — which is the spelling the authored lane
  refuses as the retired `@0.93.0` encoding (`content json shape: legacy mark
  payload`). The decoder reads a built-in's payload out of `attrs` and the
  canonical encoder writes it there, so the type named the one shape
  `applyChange` rejects and rejected the one it takes. It was survivable while
  the union carried its open arm, `{ type: string; attrs: unknown }`, whose
  shape happened to match the decoder: a correct op type-checked through the
  wrong arm. Closing the vocabularies deleted that arm and left no spelling
  that both compiles and runs. Nothing on the wire moves — the runtime accepted
  `attrs` and only `attrs` throughout — so this reaches a consumer as a type
  that stops refusing correct code. The drift was possible because the op
  restated the payload: `ContentMarkKind` names the three arms once, exported
  from the package root beside `ContentLineKind`; `ContentMark` is a range over
  it and `MarkOp`'s `add` / `remove` are a `ContentMark` under an op, so an arm
  added upstream reaches both by construction and `{ op: 'remove', ...mark }`
  type-checks for a held mark. The type guard lifts a mark's payload by name as
  it lifts a line's, beside an `@ts-expect-error` pair refusing the sibling, and
  the Rust drift guard reads the mark vocabulary off `ContentMarkKind`.
- fix(wasm,python): **`reader.getContentAt` / `get_content_at` stays.** The
  owner-call sweep took it as a call the host makes in a line or two, but
  neither read that remains is one: `reader.get` answers in the values form,
  which is text, and an anchor has no markdown projection while an island's
  `id` is re-minted by every importer, so the round-trip a nested content
  editor performs loses both; `getStored` echoes bytes under `unknown` and
  hands the codec dispatch back to the caller, which is the judgement the read
  exists to make. The verb returns in its 0.112 shape — `path` a `PathStep[]`
  walked through the field schema's `items` / `properties` / `variants` to the
  leaf, absent for a path naming nothing stored — with Python's twin taking the
  `card=` selector that replaced the `CardReader` cursor.

### The engine seam and the backends

- refactor(pdfform)!: **`quillmark-pdfform` is `quillmark-acroform`, backend id
  included.** `quillmark-pdf` and `quillmark-pdfform` differed by four
  characters and read as prefix-and-specialization, the reading #1749 records:
  that the form crate was the spine's only consumer. The spine keeps its name,
  a bare generic name reading as leaf infrastructure with many consumers, and
  the backend takes a distinct one at every layer the old one was spelled:
  crate, directory, `AcroformBackend` with `id()` of `"acroform"`, the
  `quillmark` cargo feature, the `pdfform::*` diagnostic namespace (now
  `acroform::*`, the suffixes unchanged), the WASM `DEFAULT_BACKENDS` key, the
  docs page and the two fixture quills' `backend:`. No alias: an unmigrated
  `backend: pdfform` fails at render with `engine::backend_not_found`, whose
  hint lists the registered backends, and a half-migrated quill with a leftover
  `pdfform:` section fails at load with `quill::unknown_section`. `pdf::*` is
  untouched. Closes #1775.
- refactor(typst)!: **`form-field` keeps `text` and `signature`.** `usaf_memo`
  uses those two. Checkbox and choice were the only kinds needing a value
  coercion, and both coercions were copies of the pdfform resolver's,
  duplicated because the Typst backend must not depend on it: deleting the two
  kinds deletes the duplicate, and `FieldKind`, the mirror of the spine's
  `FieldType` it existed for, retires with them — the extractor reads
  `(FieldType, Option<String>)` directly. A plate wanting an interactive
  checkbox or dropdown is a form-backend quill: pdfform keeps both kinds on
  the spine. `multiline` stays, one bool on `FieldType::Text` the spine keeps
  either way. A plate passing `type: "checkbox"` or `type: "choice"` fails the
  helper's type assert, and `options:` is no longer a parameter. Closes #1644.
- refactor(core)!: **`.quillignore` is not read; the ignore set is the built-in
  one.** A three-rule parser with a raw-string fallback — `dir/`, a literal
  name, and a glob matched against both the whole path and the basename that
  also matches the line it was written as — served a format one bundle in the
  tree used. That bundle's file was a copy-pasted demo ("This demonstrates the
  .quillignore functionality") restating the built-ins it would have inherited
  by writing nothing. The bracket-as-literal reading in the glob
  existed for `Cinzel[wght].ttf`, a name no `.quillignore` in this repo's
  history spells. `QuillIgnore` is the fixed set alone now: `.git/`, `target/`
  and `node_modules/` with their subtrees, anchored at the bundle root, and
  `.gitignore` wherever it sits. `.quillignore` leaves that set with the format
  — the loader has no reason to hide a file it no longer reads — so a bundle
  carrying one walks it into the tree as an ordinary file, and a bundle that
  relied on the file to exclude something ships that something. `QuillIgnore::new`
  and `QuillIgnore::from_content` go; `default()` and `is_ignored` stay, on what
  is now a unit struct. Refs #1641.
- fix(typst)!: **a vendored package without `typst.toml` is skipped, with the
  warning its siblings already get.** A `packages/<dir>/` carrying no manifest
  had one synthesized — `@local/<dir>:0.1.0` — and loaded under it. That spelling
  was undocumented, unfixtured and untested, and it split one package tree into
  two behaviors: the synthesized path passed no entrypoint, so it alone skipped
  the `typst::package_entrypoint_missing` check that the same files with a
  two-line manifest get. A manifest-less directory now warns under
  `typst::package_manifest`, the code its malformed-manifest and bad-version
  siblings already carry, and is skipped. The migration is the file the fallback
  was standing in for: `parse_package_toml` defaults `namespace` to `local`,
  `version` to `0.1.0` and `entrypoint` to `lib.typ`, so `[package]` plus
  `name = "<dir>"` reproduces the old spec exactly. `package_spec` and
  `entrypoint` stop being `Option` on `load_package_files_from_quill`, whose two
  call sites always passed one, and the infallible `"0.1.0".parse()` dressed as
  fallible goes with them. Refs #1698.
- refactor(core,wasm)!: **canvas preview is part of the backend contract, and
  the pre-session probe goes.** `SessionHandle::page_size_pt` and `render_rgba`
  lose their absent-reading defaults and become required, so a session paints
  by construction rather than by opting in. Each return value carried two
  meanings and now carries one: `None` and `Ok(None)` say the page is past
  `page_count()`, where they also used to say the backend had no painter.
  `update`, `regions` and `field_at` keep their defaults — this closes the
  canvas door alone. With the door shut, the probe that guessed at it goes at
  every layer: `Quillmark::supports_canvas`,
  `quillmark_core::formats_support_canvas`, the WASM
  `Engine.supportsCanvas(quill)` and `LiveSession.supportsCanvas` getters, and
  the `canvas` key of a runtime `BackendDescriptor`, leaving a descriptor's
  manifest as `formats` alone. It keyed on output formats — true iff the
  backend emitted PNG or SVG — while paint is a `SessionHandle` seam a backend
  overrides independently, so the two could disagree; every backend the
  workspace ships paints, so it answered `true` in every build.
  `LiveSession::supports_canvas()` reduced to `page_count() > 0`, which is what
  a Rust caller writes instead. Both shipped backends already implement the
  pair, so no rendered pixel moves. A compile with nothing to paint meets the
  out-of-range refusal, `"paint: page index 0 out of range (pageCount=0)"`, in
  place of a message naming a painter the backend has. Closes #1706.
- refactor(pdfform)!: **the SVG and PNG output formats go; canvas paint
  stays.** `supported_formats` reports `[Pdf]`, so a `render` asking for either
  fails under `backend::format_not_supported`, and `quillmark render --format
  png` on a pdfform quill does too. The two formats were views of the flattened
  form consumed by nothing but their own test. `render_rgba` and the `hayro`
  dependency stay, so a WASM consumer paints pdfform pages exactly as before:
  paint is a `SessionHandle` seam, not an output format. `hayro-svg` goes with
  the SVG artifact path, its only caller.
- refactor(core,wasm,python)!: **the `producer` render option goes; the
  `/Producer` stamp it overrode stays.** `RenderOptions::producer` and
  `with_producer`, the WASM key and Python's `producer=` keyword are deleted.
  No first-party caller set it, and the engine carried the string through four
  crates and two bindings to reach a writer a host can reach directly. Every
  rendered PDF still carries `Quillmark <version>`: the default sits in
  `quillmark-pdf`'s `StampOptions::default()`, one `format!` over
  `version.workspace = true` in place of a `default_producer()` in each
  backend. `StampOptions::producer` becomes a plain `String`, so `stamp` always
  appends its `/Info` revision where a producer-less call over an empty field
  list returned the base bytes; both backends always passed a producer, so no
  render changes.
- refactor(all)!: **the crate-compatibility ceremony is withdrawn:
  `#[non_exhaustive]`, the `Backend` seal, public `register_backend`, and the
  SemVer promise `COMPATIBILITY.md` carried.** The attribute leaves the 86
  items that held it, so a struct literal, functional update and exhaustive
  destructuring compile out-of-crate again — `RenderOptions { ..,
  ..Default::default() }` among them. Its one observable effect was the forced
  `_` arm, which hides a variant a build has not learned instead of reporting
  it: the WASM and Python `Severity` conversions folded an unmatched level into
  `Error`, and both now match every variant. `Backend` loses its
  `sealed::Sealed` supertrait; implementing the trait outside the workspace
  stays impossible, because `Backend::open` returns a `LiveSession` only a
  `#[doc(hidden)]` `SessionHandle` builds and `Quillmark::register_backend` is
  private, leaving `Quillmark::new` as the whole registry.
  `prose/canon/COMPATIBILITY.md` is deleted — a promise to crates.io consumers
  that, per its own text, no CI job checked; its table of `pub` seams that
  serve the workspace rather than a consumer moves into `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
  backend section.
- fix(typst,pdfform)!: **`RenderOptions::pages` means one thing on every
  backend, under `backend::*` codes.** The PDF-form backend ignored the option:
  it rendered every page whatever was asked for, and an out-of-range index
  passed silently. It refuses a selection now, PDF being its one format, and
  both backends mint the two refusals from the shared constructors in
  `quillmark_core::backend`, so the codes are
  `backend::page_index_out_of_bounds` and
  `backend::page_selection_not_supported` in place of the Typst-private
  `typst::*` pair.
- fix(typst,pdfform)!: **a raster nobody can allocate is refused, not
  attempted.** `RenderOptions.ppi` and the `render_rgba` canvas scale reached
  tiny-skia and hayro unchecked; both size their buffer from the value and
  unwrap it, so `ppi: Infinity` or `1e9` panicked the process — in WASM a trap
  that takes the engine instance with it — while NaN, zero and a negative
  quietly rasterized a 1×1 image. Every raster path refuses under
  `backend::invalid_raster_scale` a scale that is not finite and positive, or
  that would put a page past `MAX_RASTER_PIXELS` (16384² px: a 1 GiB RGBA
  buffer, and the area of the WASM painter's per-side clamp, so nothing that
  clamp admits is refused). US Letter at the default 144 ppi is 138× under it.
  `SessionHandle::render_rgba` and `LiveSession::render_rgba` return
  `Result<Option<(u32, u32, Vec<u8>)>, RenderError>` to carry the refusal;
  `Ok(None)` is still the out-of-range page.
- fix(pdfform)!: **canvas geometry measures from the page's canvas box.** hayro
  rasterizes `/CropBox` ∩ `/MediaBox` and draws that box's lower-left corner at
  the raster's origin, while `page_size_pt` reported the `/MediaBox` extent and
  `regions()` reported widget `/Rect`s in raw user space. An overlay over a
  `pdfcrop`ped background (`/MediaBox [96 133 500 700]`) therefore sat 96 × 133
  pt off its ink, and a `/CropBox` inside the MediaBox reported a page bigger
  than its own raster. `page_size_pt` is the canvas box's extent, `regions()`
  subtracts its lower-left corner, and `form.json`'s top-left rects flip
  against it, so `pageSize`, `regions`, the point queries and the raster share
  one origin. Values move only on a page whose canvas box does not start at
  `(0, 0)`. The stamped PDF's widget `/Rect`s stay in user space.
  `quillmark_pdf::page_media_boxes` is `page_canvas_boxes`, and it refuses a
  canvas box under a point per side (`pdf::degenerate_page_box`) and a page box
  that is not a direct array of numbers.
- fix(pdfform)!: **flatten's own parse failure is `acroform::flatten_parse`.** A
  page dict or `/Contents` the content-stream flattener cannot read raised
  `pdf::flatten_parse`, naming the stamp spine for a failure of the backend's
  own code. The backend's namespace renames later in this same cycle, so the
  code ships as `acroform::flatten_parse`, not the `pdfform::` spelling the
  commit landed. `pdf::bad_rect` stays the spine's and is minted in one place,
  `FieldSpec::assert_finite_rect`, which the stamp and flatten paths both call.
- feat(typst,pdfform,cli)!: **`pdfform::form_schema_version` retires, and the
  CLI loses three flags.** A `form@0.1.0` file still fails to load, now as an
  unrecognised tag under `acroform::invalid_form_json` (the namespace renames
  later in this cycle). `render --verbose` is
  deleted, so `--quiet` states what it suppresses on its own; `schema -o` and
  `blueprint -o` are deleted, both commands writing to stdout where `>` does
  the rest. `render -o` is unchanged. `validate` reads `plate_file` from the
  loaded quill rather than the filesystem, so a plate the load excludes fails
  validation, which is what rendering it already did.
- change(typst): **an image in a content field draws nothing and warns.** What
  a content image's `url` names is undecided — a document is quill-free but for
  `$quill`, which selects a *range* of versions, and declares everything else
  it references — so the Typst backend lowers an `image` island to nothing
  rather than binding one reading of the string. A quill asset stays the
  plate's to draw (`#image("assets/logo.svg")`), unchanged. The refusal is
  legible where it used to be a Typst file-not-found error about a generated
  file the author never wrote: one **`backend::declined_construct`** warning
  per content field, `args` `{backend, construct, count}` and the field's
  `DocPath` in `path`, minted by the new `quillmark_core::declined_construct`
  so it cannot drift from quill-declared `plate::unsupported_construct` — the
  sixth warning family, and the first a backend *observes* rather than a quill
  declares. **A consumer routing on diagnostic codes gains a warning family**
  and needs an arm for it. Storage is untouched: an `image` island still
  parses, stores, round-trips to markdown and reaches an editor with its `{url,
  alt}` props.
- fix(typst): **a compile diagnostic carries a code from a closed set.** The
  code was the message up to its first `:`, so a missing asset minted
  `typst::file not found (searched at assets/logo.png)` — the author's path
  inside what consumers route on, one code per input — and a URL truncated
  mid-value to `typst::file not found (searched at https`. Most Typst messages
  hold no `:` at all, so the whole sentence became the code. The mapping
  classifies: `typst::file_not_found`, `typst::unknown_variable`,
  `typst::type_error`, and `typst::compile` for every message the set does not
  name, warnings included. Typst's sentence, and the path it searched, stay in
  `message`.
- fix(typst): **a `form-field` widget's rect is the box it prints in, whatever
  the layout context.** The helper emitted its `<__qm_field__>` metadata beside
  the box rather than inside it, and a tag's own position is the line's
  baseline inline and the flow cursor's left edge in a block: an inline widget
  reported a rect one box-height low, and one under `#align(center, ..)`
  reported the left margin. The tag rides in the box body, whose origin is the
  box's top-left in every layout context, so `session.regions()`, `fieldAt` and
  the stamped AcroForm `/Rect` all land on the widget. A plate that compensated
  for the offset shifts by that much.
- fix(typst): **`escape_markup` lowers every character Typst reads as a newline
  to a space.** A content that reached the emitter without passing the ingress
  — hand-built, or decoded from storage — could still carry `\r`, VT, FF, NEL,
  U+2028 or U+2029, and the emitter wrote it through: the text behind it parsed
  as a heading, list or term marker the document never wrote. One character to
  one byte, so the per-character span scan stays exact.
- fix(typst): the font loader drops its `woff`/`woff2` extension arms, which
  parsed nothing, and the data codegen drops its skip of a `__meta__` key
  nothing produces.
- refactor(typst): **a compile's form fields cross to the PDF spine as one
  derivation.** `Compiled` carries `field_specs: Vec<FieldSpec>` built with the
  compile: `widget_regions` is `regions_of` over it and `render_document_pages`
  stamps it directly, where each PDF render had rebuilt the specs from the
  placements, page-height scan included. A placement naming a page outside the
  document fails the compile alongside the extraction errors it sits with,
  instead of emptying the session's regions and surfacing at render.
- fix(core): **the default `field_at` hands a tie to the later-painted
  placement.** It ranked `regions()` with `min_by`, which keeps the first of
  equal distances, so two placements on one rect resolved to the one underneath
  — against the documented contract and against the Typst backend, which
  overrides `field_at` with later-wins. The default walks `regions()` in
  reverse, so a pdfform quill whose widgets overlap answers with the
  last-stamped one.
- refactor(core,typst,pdfform): **the default PPI is stated once, as
  `RenderOptions::DEFAULT_PPI`.** Each raster backend carried its own
  `DEFAULT_PPI = 144.0` const, one of them documented as mirroring a core
  constant that did not exist. `RenderOptions::ppi_or_default()` resolves the
  option against that constant and both backends call it. Additive on the core
  API; the resolved value is unchanged.

### The PDF spine

- refactor(pdf,acroform)!: **a stamped widget draws its own value, so the second
  PDF goes.** A widget carried `/NeedAppearances` and no appearance stream, so
  the value reached only a viewer that synthesizes one and a flat rasterizer
  drew an empty box. The form backend worked around that for its canvas by
  building a whole second document — `flatten.rs` and `typography.rs`, 850 lines
  — that baked each value into the page content streams, which meant resolving
  inherited `/Resources`, inlining an indirect `/Font` dict, picking a resource
  name free in the page's own, and splicing a `/Contents` that might name an
  array object. The stamp now writes one `/AP` `/N` Form XObject per drawn
  value, over a `/BBox` the size of the field box and its own one-entry
  `/Resources`: the page is not touched, so none of that surgery has anything to
  resolve. One document is the deliverable and the raster both, the preview is
  the file, and a Typst `form-field` carrying a `value:` bakes one too. `/V`
  stays the source of truth — the stream draws WinAnsi, from the left edge, and
  the `/BBox` clips it — and `/NeedAppearances` still hands a synthesizing
  viewer the whole value. With no second path to share them, `quillmark-pdf`'s
  two `#[doc(hidden)] pub` modules are private and `PdfUpdate::begin` stops
  taking a producer it was always given. Closes #1645.
- fix(pdf): **a stamped checkbox's `/DA` names ZapfDingbats.** `stamp` wrote a
  checkbox's `/MK /CA (4)` caption and no `/DA`, so the widget inherited the
  form-level `/Helv 0 Tf 0 g` and nothing registered the face the glyph lives
  in: a viewer synthesizing the appearance under `/NeedAppearances` drew the
  digit `4`, while the canvas raster drew the check mark through a real
  ZapfDingbats resource. The widget now carries `/DA (/ZaDb 0 Tf 0 g)`, and
  `/DR /Font` registers `/ZaDb` whenever a checkbox is present; `spec.font`
  stays inert on a checkbox. The face, its resource name and the glyph are
  `quillmark_pdf::{CHECK_FONT, CHECK_FONT_RESOURCE, CHECK_GLYPH}`, which the
  acroform flatten path now reads rather than restating. Closes #1779.
- fix(pdf): **one predicate for the checkbox on-state.** `stamp` read any
  `Some` value as checked and `flatten` only `Some("Yes")`, so a
  `FieldSpec::value` the contract excludes — `value` is public — stamped
  `/V /Yes` on a widget the raster drew blank. `FieldSpec::is_checked` is the
  one reading, the strict one, and both paths call it. Closes #1780.
- fix(acroform): **a value carrying a newline binds to a multiline widget.**
  `bind` decided `MULTILINE` from the schema type, so a richtext of two
  paragraphs, a `String` block scalar, or any value whose projection keeps a
  `\n` reached the stamped widget single-line unless `ui.multiline` said
  otherwise, while the flattened raster stacked the lines: the author saw the
  value in the preview and one line of it in the file. `resolve::field_spec`
  now promotes a `Text` widget to multiline when the value it resolved holds a
  `\n`, reading the same string the raster draws. An array's widget stays
  multiline unconditionally, value or none, since a signer types its elements
  one per line. Closes #1781.
- refactor(pdfform): **a checkbox reads a bool.** `is_truthy` accepted
  `"yes"`, `"on"`, `"y"`, `"checked"`, `"1"` and any nonzero number beside
  `true`. Nothing reaches it: a `checkbox` widget binds only to a `boolean`
  schema field, and `resolve` runs against `compile_data`, where
  `conform_value` has already turned a bool, a `"true"`/`"false"` spelling and
  a number into a JSON bool — and refused everything else as
  `CoercionError::uncoercible` before any widget resolves. So the vocabulary
  was not a tolerance but a second, *wider* one behind a door the first never
  opens: `"yes"` checks the box here and fails the compile upstream. The module
  binds against `compile_data` precisely so coercion is inherited rather than
  re-implemented, which is the line `is_truthy` crossed. `matches!(raw,
  Value::Bool(true))` is the whole rule now. No reachable behavior changes.
- fix(pdf): **a stamped trailer carries one `/Info`, whatever shape the base's
  `/Info` had.** The producer stamp allocated a fresh information dictionary
  whenever the trailer's `/Info` did not parse as an indirect reference, while
  the trailer writer copied the old value forward regardless, so a direct-dict
  `/Info << /Title (x) >>` came out as two `/Info` keys in one dict — undefined
  per spec, parser-dependent in practice. The fresh reference supersedes the
  old value, and a direct dict's entries seed the object it names, so `/Title`
  and the rest survive the stamp.
- fix(pdf): **the object index skips literal strings, `%`-comments and stream
  bodies, so `N G obj` bytes carried as content cannot shadow the real
  object.** The scan accepted any `<id> <gen> obj` at a token boundary and a
  later occurrence overwrites an earlier one, so a header spelled inside a
  string value (`/Subject (see 4 0 obj)`) or inside raw stream data displaced
  the real object's offset. `find_endobj_end` skips stream bodies too: `endobj`
  bytes in stream data truncated the object body.
- fix(pdf): **a dict ending in a hex string parses to its real `>>`.** The
  scanner stepped over literal strings and `%`-comments but read a hex string
  as ordinary bytes, so the string's own `>` abutting the dict's `>>` closed
  the dict one byte early: `<< /T <41>>>` read as ` /T <41`, and a `/Producer`
  stamp rewrote the `/Info` with an unterminated `<…` — a title lost to any
  reader. `skip_string_or_comment` steps a `<` that no `<` follows to just past
  its `>`, which the dict, array and `endobj` scans all inherit. The trigger is
  real: pdf-writer's compact mode, which krilla and typst-pdf use, writes a
  non-ASCII `/Title` or `/Author` exactly this way.
- fix(pdf): **an inheritable page attribute resolves along the page's own
  ancestor chain, not the root `/Pages` node alone.** `/Rotate` and `/MediaBox`
  were read from the page dict and then from the root, so a base whose
  intermediate `/Pages` node carries `/Rotate 90` passed the rotation guard and
  every stamped widget landed a quarter turn off, and a page inheriting its
  `/MediaBox` from an intermediate node was flipped against the root's page
  height. The `/Kids` walk carries each page's ancestor ids, nearest first, and
  both readers consult the page dict then that chain (ISO 32000-1 §7.7.3.4).
- fix(pdf): **a `/Rotate` the reader cannot read as an integer refuses the
  stamp.** `assert_unrotated_pages` parsed the raw value and treated a failure
  as an absence, so `/Rotate 7 0 R` — legal for any dict value — climbed past
  the page and fell to the default zero, stamping every widget in unrotated
  user space onto a page the viewer turns. The first *present* value along the
  ancestor chain binds: a direct integer is checked as before
  (`pdf::rotated_page`), anything else is `pdf::parse`.
- fix(pdf): **a base PDF whose trailer `/Size` sits above `i32::MAX` is refused
  rather than panicking mid-stamp.** `alloc_id` bounded only `u32` overflow, so
  a `/Size` in `2^31 ..= 2^32-2` handed out ids that cast to a negative `i32`
  and pdf-writer's `Ref::new` panicked — a crafted `form.pdf` opened cleanly
  and then took down the process, and with it a WASM module. `alloc_id` stops
  at `i32::MAX`, and every id that becomes a reference goes through a checked
  `to_ref`, which also covers the base page ids that never pass through
  `alloc_id`.
- fix(pdfform): **flatten keeps the background's resources and its own
  `/Contents`.** `/Resources` is inheritable, so writing a fresh one onto a
  page that carried none shadowed the ancestor's dict and unbound every name
  the background stream selects; the effective dict is resolved up `/Parent`,
  inlined onto the page and extended there. The drawn fonts take names free in
  that dict (`Helv2` where `Helv` is taken), since a second binding for a name
  the background uses rebinds it under a last-wins parser. A `/Contents`
  reference naming an *array* object expands to its elements instead of being
  wrapped.
- fix(pdfform): **a flattened value asserts black fill and the default text
  state before it draws.** The appended stream opened with `q` and set only
  `Tf`, and a page's `/Contents` array is one stream, so a background's
  unpaired `0.9 g` or `3 Tr` — a shaded field box, a scanned form's invisible
  OCR layer — carried into the drawn value and rastered it near-white or blank,
  with no diagnostic. Both writers open with `0 g 0 Tr 0 Tc 0 Tw 100 Tz 0 Ts`,
  the state the stamped `/DA` starts from. Canvas paint only: the AcroForm PDF
  deliverable is stamped, not flattened.
- refactor(pdf): **one ancestor chain per page.** `PdfUpdate::resolve_pages`
  returns `Vec<Page>` rather than page ids: each `Page` carries its `/Pages`
  ancestors from the `/Kids` walk and resolves any inheritable attribute
  through `Page::inherited_attribute`. Flatten reads `/Resources` through it
  instead of climbing `/Parent` on its own, so rotation, media box and
  resources answer from the same chain under the same cycle and depth guards.

### Schema, validation and the resolved view

- fix(core)!: **a quill declaring more fields than a card carries is refused at
  load.** `MAX_FIELD_COUNT` (1000) bounds one card-yaml block and every
  incremental field write charges it, but `Quill::seed_document` and
  `QuillConfig::blueprint` build a card from its schema wholesale: a `Quill.yaml`
  declaring 1001 fields under `main:` or under one `card_kinds.<name>:` loaded
  clean, and the failure landed at an exit: emitted markdown the parser refuses,
  and a card storage refuses. The load counts each card's declared fields and
  reports `quill::too_many_fields` naming the card, so the defect reaches the quill
  author in the artifact that holds it and both schema-driven constructions are
  total over every loaded quill. The count is per card and over declared fields
  alone: a nested `properties` map, an array's `items` and a `variants:` cell set
  ride inside the one field declaring them. Closes #1792.
- fix(core)!: **a field write past the §8 field count is refused at the write.**
  `Card::store_field` validated a field's name and its value's depth and left the
  card's field count to the parser and the two storage doors, so a program could
  build a card past `MAX_FIELD_COUNT` (1000) through `storeField` / `storeFill` /
  `storeFields`, the typed `set` / `set_all` / `addCard`, or `revise` /
  `overwrite` on an absent field — and learn of it only at `toMarkdown`,
  `toStored`, or the card wire, each of which refused what the API had taken.
  Every field write funnels through one `Payload::insert` that holds the count,
  so an append past the cap is `edit::invalid_payload` carrying
  `PayloadViolation::TooManyFields` — the code the wire already mints for this
  violation — anchored at the card that is full. A replace is not a growth and
  still lands. The batches charge the count over the whole batch and report one
  diagnostic per name in the overflowing tail, applying none of themselves.
  Closes #1750.
- refactor(core)!: **an enum's domain rides the type token.** `FieldType::Enum`
  carries `values`, and `FieldSchema::enum_values` is gone. The domain and the
  token had to agree, an agreement the loader enforced and the type could not,
  so every consumer keyed on the carrier and left a `FieldType::Enum` arm behind
  as unreachable residue — three of them, each answering "no domain" differently:
  the transform schema projected `{type: string}`, an open domain contradicting
  the token; validation skipped the membership check; pdfform refused to bind.
  One rule replaces them, special-cased nowhere: a domain admits its members and
  the blank, so an empty one admits only the blank. `FieldSchema::domain()`
  answers it for the three branches that enter through `variants:` holding no
  token. No quill loads differently and no stored or wire byte moves: `values:`
  is still the one spelling, still required non-empty on `type: enum`, still a
  load error elsewhere, and `Serialize` re-emits it from the payload in the slot
  it already occupied.
- feat(core,wasm,python)!: **a quill carries the load's advisory diagnostics,
  so they reach a binding host at last.** `Quill::warnings()` is new, mirrored
  as `quill.warnings` in WASM and Python, and it answers whatever
  `QuillConfig::from_yaml_with_warnings` collected. Every construction door
  keeps them, which retires the two that existed only because the field was
  missing: `Quill::from_tree_with_warnings` and
  `quillmark::quill_from_path_with_warnings` are gone, and `from_tree` /
  `quill_from_path` are the whole surface. Closes #1625: `Quill::from_tree` was
  the door every binding took and the one that dropped them, so
  `quill::implicit_group` and `quill::body_example_unused` were visible only to
  the CLI's `validate`.
- feat(core)!: **five retired `Quill.yaml` keys lose their tailored migration
  message, and an implicit group is a load error.** `must_fill`, `enum`,
  `ui.order`, the `richtext(inline)` type token and `markdown` were retired
  across 0.94, 0.104 and 0.108, each with a hand-written sentence naming its
  replacement. All five still fail to load, now under
  `quill::field_parse_error` with serde's unknown-key text and no hint.
  Separately, a `ui.group` on a card with no `ui.groups` registry is
  `quill::implicit_group` at **error** severity, the promotion that warning's
  own text scheduled. Note for a WASM or Python host: that warning never
  reached you (#1625), so the error is the first notice. Declare the registry.
- fix(core)!: **`Quill::validate` refuses every value the render floor
  refuses.** Validation judged a floor refusal by the authored value's own
  shape, and two shapes read well-typed there: a content object that is not
  canonical content on a `richtext` or `plaintext` field (`{prose: older}`),
  and an integer past `i64` on an `integer` field. Both audited clean while
  `compile_data` and `dry_run` refused them, so the `validate`/`dry_run`
  pairing an editor runs on gave two verdicts. A leaf the floor cannot conform
  is a `validation::type_mismatch` at the field's path, unless a shape check
  already names the refusal (`validation::not_inline`, `validation::not_plain`,
  `validation::format_violation`); a container's refusal stays the element's or
  property's, at its own path. A numeric literal past `i64` reports `actual:
  number`, the type that does carry it, and such a literal in a `default:` or
  `example:` is a load error.
- fix(core): **a type mismatch names the field's own declared type, so `date`,
  `datetime` and `enum` report themselves.** The validator collapsed the three
  onto `string`, so `due: 20260101` against `type: date` read "schema declares
  `string`" — a type the schema does not declare, with an exit that discards
  the field's format. The declared type has one source, `FieldType::as_str`,
  and `validation::type_mismatch` carries the name in `args.expected`.
- fix(core): **a `$seed` overlay cell is validated as the document value it
  is.** `validate` judged each cell as a Quill.yaml schema literal, a context
  that refuses the container spelling of a variant-bearing enum and reads a
  present-null as a typed value, so `classification: { value: CUI, note: hello
  }` and `author: null` each drew a `validation::type_mismatch` warning while
  `seed_card` committed both. An overlay cell takes the same pass a card's own
  fields take. Overlays stay advisory and never gate render.
- fix(core): **a seeded variant commits its cells without a discriminant to
  name their world.** `seed_card` needed the overlay or an `example:` to name a
  member and dropped the whole field otherwise, so a `$seed` entry was honored
  for a card's plain fields and silently discarded for its variant-bearing one.
  The world walked is the render floor's own selection — overlay › `example:` ›
  `default:` › blank — and the container commits whenever a cell has something
  to commit. `value` is written only where the overlay or an `example:` named
  the member, so a `default:` stays deferred to the floor.
- fix(core): **`$seed` writes only on the card carrying `$kind: main`.**
  `store_seed_overlay` is inherent on `Card` and `card_mut` / `cards_mut` hand
  out `&mut Card`, so a root-only `$seed` reached a placed composable card
  after the positional gate on `push_card` / `insert_card` had run, producing a
  document that emits markdown the parser refuses and fails its own serde round
  trip. The card answers this about itself, so both mutable doors are covered
  at once.
- fix(core): **`Quill::resolve` keeps a mis-shaped container value raw rather
  than blanking it under the document's own label.** A seed the render coercion
  cannot conform — `rows: abc` on an `array`, `addr: 5` on a typed dictionary —
  was rebuilt from the schema anyway, so the row showed an empty container
  still tagged `authored`. The container arms compose an absent or
  already-shaped seed only, and anything else falls through to the keep-raw
  path `conform_card_render` documents. The render gate refuses the shape, so
  the plate is unchanged.
- fix(core): **a variant container the document wrote reads `authored`
  whichever rung filled its discriminant.** `resolve()` lifted a present
  container off the blank rung only, so `classification: {}` reported `default`
  where the schema declared one and `authored` where it did not — the reported
  rung turning on the schema rather than the document. A present container is
  `authored`; a present-null still reads as absent and keeps the discriminant's
  rung.
- fix(core): **a blank `main.description` emits no description line in the
  blueprint.** The main card tested the raw string for emptiness and collapsed
  whitespace afterwards, so `main: { description: "   " }` landed as a bare `#
  ` above the first field. The collapse runs first, and a description that
  collapses to nothing falls through to `quill.description`.
- fix(core): **a nested richtext `example:` reaches the blueprint as its `#
  e.g.` hint.** A richtext cell never inlines its example, and the per-property
  builder for typed-dict properties and typed-table rows gated the hint on
  `default:` alone, so a defaultless richtext property's `example:` appeared in
  neither the cell nor a hint. Both gates are one helper, as BLUEPRINT.md §
  Typed dictionaries states.

### The CLI

- fix(cli): **`render` parses a `MARKDOWN_FILE` through the bound door, so
  `conform::*` and `plate::unsupported_construct` warnings reach stderr.** The
  command called `Document::parse`, the transport door, which runs neither the
  conform walk nor the declined-construct walk: a `usaf_memo` body carrying a
  `***` rendered with an empty stderr where every other surface warns. It calls
  `Quill::parse` instead. Rendered bytes are the same — the coercion pass
  already ran in `compile_data` — and a `$quill` naming another quill refuses
  at parse rather than at compile, with the same diagnostics and the same exit
  1.
- fix(cli): **`validate` states each failure once.** A failing run printed its
  own summary and then a second copy through the error it returned, which
  `main` labelled `[ERROR] Invalid argument:` — including on a load failure,
  which is a quill config failure and not an argument the caller got wrong. The
  command returns `CliError::Reported` once it has written the per-diagnostic
  lines and the summary. Exit status stays 1 on every path.
- fix(cli): **`-f PDF` writes `example.pdf`.** `--format` parses
  case-insensitively, but the derived output filename, the `example.<fmt>`
  fallback and the multi-page `--stdout` refusal interpolated the flag as
  typed. All three read the parsed format's lowercase id.
- docs(cli): **the exit-code table separates a usage error from a refusal.**
  The CLI reference and the crate README both promised `1` on any error, while
  `clap` exits `2` on an invocation it cannot parse — an unknown flag, a
  missing argument, an unknown subcommand — before any command runs. `1` is the
  command running and refusing. `--help` and `--version` exit `0`. A smoke test
  pins the `2`.

### The Rust surface

- refactor(core,quillmark)!: **every `quillmark-core` item is named at the module
  that defines it.** The crate declared its thirteen modules `pub` and
  re-exported 77 of their items at the root, so `quillmark_core::Document` and
  `quillmark_core::document::Document` both resolved and first-party callers used
  both; neither spelling was the one a reader could rely on seeing. The root
  re-exports go and the modules stay public, which leaves Rust's own rule as the
  whole of it: an item is reachable where it is defined. `Content` and
  `Normalized` keep their root spelling, the root being the only path core offers
  those two `quillmark-content` types. `quillmark::orchestration` goes the same
  way, leaving `Quillmark` named once at the facade root. Every removed path is
  an unresolved import, so the compiler names each of the 328 call sites; the
  `quillmark` facade re-exports the same list from the module-qualified core
  paths, so a consumer on the facade has nothing to do and no binding surface
  moves. `quillmark-pdf` already carried the one-path shape and needed no change.
  Closes #1791.
- feat(core,quillmark): **`Normalized` and `ImportError` are nameable from core
  and the facade.** `quillmark_content::model::Normalized` is what `Card::body`
  returns, what `overwrite_body` / `overwrite_field` take on `Card` and
  `CardMut`, what all four `get_content` / `get_content_at` answer in, and what
  `dto::CanonicalContent` wraps; `quillmark_content::import::ImportError` is the
  payload of `EditError::Import`. No crate on that path re-exported either, so a
  consumer holding only `quillmark-core`, or only the facade, could bind what
  those verbs return but not write the type, and could not destructure the
  import refusal to read its depth. `Normalized` now sits beside the `Content`
  re-export it completes and `ImportError` beside `EditError`, both reach the
  facade, and `tests/facade_surface.rs` names them through the content lane.
  What `quillmark-content` carries *inside* the types core forwards — `Mark`,
  `Line`, `Island` and the enums they name — stays that crate's own surface.
  Closes #1790.
- refactor(content)!: **every `quillmark-content` item is named at the module
  that defines it.** The crate declared its ten modules `pub` and re-exported 34
  of their items at the root, so `quillmark_content::Delta` and
  `quillmark_content::delta::Delta` both resolved and first-party callers used
  both; neither spelling was the one a reader could rely on seeing. The root
  re-exports go and the modules stay public, which leaves Rust's own rule as the
  whole of it: an item is reachable where it is defined. `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` and
  `MAX_JSON_DEPTH` keep their root spelling, the crate root being where they are
  defined. Every removed path is an unresolved import, so the compiler names each
  site; the names `quillmark-core` re-exports keep their core spellings, so a
  consumer on core or on the `quillmark` facade has nothing to do, and no binding
  surface moves. Closes #1755.
- refactor(core): **`ParseError::code` is the one variant-to-code match.**
  `code()` joins the three siblings that already carry the same
  `fn code(&self) -> &'static str` — `EditError`, `ValidationError`,
  `WireError` — and `to_diagnostic` reads it rather than spelling a second
  nine-arm table beside `args()`. What is left there is a two-arm decoration
  match over the only variants carrying a hint or a location. Refs #1748.
- refactor(core)!: **the raw-plate test seam is `#[doc(hidden)]`, not a cargo
  feature.** `internal-test-seam` gated one method,
  `LiveSession::update_data`, and the crate's `[features]` table held nothing
  else; both go, and the method compiles into every build. A cargo feature is
  public surface itself — crates.io and docs.rs advertise it — so the gate moved
  the opt-in from a source read to a `Cargo.toml` line rather than removing it,
  and the callable-vs-not difference it bought is already given away next door:
  `LiveSession::new` and `SessionHandle` are `#[doc(hidden)] pub` in every
  build, and a session assembled through them reaches the same unchecked
  `update`. The typst backend's dev-dependency on core carried the feature and
  nothing else, so it goes too; `[dependencies]` already names core, which is
  what its acceptance tests link. Refs #1748.
- fix(core)!: **a placed card is reached as a `CardMut`, not a `&mut Card`.**
  `main_mut` / `card_mut` / `cards_mut` handed out `&mut Card`, so a whole-card
  assignment wrote past every gate that polices placement:
  `*doc.card_mut(0).unwrap() = doc.main().clone()` put `$quill` and `$seed` on a
  composable card that `push_card` refuses, and `*doc.main_mut() =
  Card::new("note")?` took `$quill` off the root, which `quill_reference`
  `expect`s present — a release panic on the next bound door. `main_mut` and
  `card_mut` return `CardMut`, which forwards every `&mut self` verb `Card`
  carries and `Deref`s for the reads with no `DerefMut`, so a chained call
  compiles unchanged and the assignment does not compile at all. `cards_mut` is
  withdrawn: `move_card` / `remove_card` / `insert_card` are the slice ops and
  `cards` / `card` the reads. No binding surface exposed a `&mut Card`.
  Closes #1750.
- refactor(core): **a quill reference parses its selector token directly.**
  `QuillReference::from_str` split `name@selector` and then re-prefixed the
  half it had just split off — `VersionSelector::from_str(&format!("@{}",
  part))` — so the selector parser carried a `written` flag to tell the typo
  `memo@` from the absent selector in `memo`, a distinction only the caller
  ever had in hand. `VersionSelector::from_token` parses the unprefixed token
  and refuses the empty one, `from_str` is the written spelling over it, and
  the allocation per parse goes. Parsed values, `Display` output and error
  strings are unchanged, which is what the untouched selector tests assert.
- feat(core)!: **five `quillmark-core` document verbs with no caller are
  gone.** `Document::to_plate_json` was the schema-free spelling of the
  crate-internal `to_plate_json_gated` every render already takes, so the plate
  export leaves the public Rust surface; no binding ever carried it.
  `Document::card_kinds` had one caller, a test. `impl IntoIterator for
  &Payload` duplicated `Payload::iter`. `MetaKey::ALL` and
  `MetaKey::is_root_only` enumerated a two-member set to find `Seed`.
  `PathStepWire` and the `CommentPathSegment` alias were a second and third
  name for `PathSegment`. The bytes do not move.
- feat(core,content)!: **unread accessors leave `quillmark-core` and
  `quillmark-content`.** `YamlError::line` / `column` / `hint` had no caller
  outside one test; a consumer reads the position off `to_diagnostic`.
  `RenderedRegion::contains` had none outside its own, and `field_at` never
  shared it — it ranks by `distance` under a tolerance. `print_errors` is gone;
  its one caller, the CLI, carries the two-line loop. `normalize_document`
  returns a `Document` rather than a `Result` it never filled. `Delta::apply`,
  which panicked on a delta built against a longer revision, folds into the
  checked `try_apply`; `ChangeBundle::from_delta` had two callers, both tests.
  Two additions come with them: `RenderError::coded_hint`, the coded-plus-hint
  shape four `backend.rs` refusals built by hand, and `region::nearest_region`,
  the tolerant search `SessionHandle::field_at` and the Typst backend each
  carried a copy of.
- refactor(core): **`QuillValue` holds its JSON, not a mirror of it.** The
  value carried a private `Node`/`Kind` tree annotating every node with one
  `fill` bit, plus a seeded `serde_json::Value` cache of the same data — so
  `from_json` deep-cloned the whole document to record markers almost none of
  it carries, and `get` cloned a subtree twice to read one child. No consumer
  wanted the tree: emit, both wire formats, seeding, compose and conform all
  ask for a flat path list, which is what `Seeded` already wrote by hand and
  what the DTO's `nested_fills` already stores. `QuillValue` is that pair — the
  JSON beside a duplicate-free `Vec<Vec<PathSegment>>` — so the two node
  walkers collapse to one `json_at`, and `OnceLock` and the hand-written
  `Clone` / `PartialEq` go with them. The public surface is unchanged;
  `set_fill_at` still refuses a path that addresses nothing, and records a
  marker where a walk of the JSON meets it, so `fill_paths` reads in
  declaration order and the `nested_fills` a stored document carries are
  byte-for-byte what 0.112 wrote.
- refactor(core): **every surface that refuses a non-content richtext value
  spells one sentence.** `Codec::decode_field` builds the shape-mismatch
  message and names the shape that arrived (`expected a richtext content object
  or a markdown string, got a number`); the wire `$body` reader and the
  richtext write coercion route through it. `Card::store_ext` bounds `$ext`
  depth through `value::depth_check_meta_map`, the check the wire and the
  storage DTO run. Every diagnostic code is unchanged.
- refactor(core): **`FieldViolation` spells its own message, once.** The parse,
  wire and storage boundaries each re-spelled the three field-invariant
  reasons, and the wording had drifted apart. `Display` gives the reason alone
  and `FieldViolation::message(key)` names the key inline, which all three
  boundaries wrap. The parse path's dead `FillOnMapping` arm goes with the
  match it lived in.
- refactor(core): **the prescan's frame stack carries no `kind`.** `Frame.kind`
  and `FrameKind` were written at every push and read nowhere but the write
  that filled them.
- refactor(content): **code-block import filters its text through
  `Inline::push_text`.** `push_code_line` differed from it only in dropping a
  `\n` where `push_text` spaces one, and its segments come from a
  `split('\n')`, so the two agree on every input it receives.
- refactor(quillmark): **`Quillmark::render` resolves the backend once.** It
  called `supported_formats` and `open`, each resolving the quill's backend
  separately. Same diagnostics in the same order.
- refactor(core/quill): `is_valid_quill_name` drops its exemption for the
  literal `__default__`, a name no quill, fixture, test or doc in the tree
  carries.

### Docs and tests

- docs(content): **`ISLAND_SLOT` says who removes a stray one.** The constant
  called a slot with no island an invariant violation and stopped there, which
  read as the codecs contradicting the model when they drop one on import. They
  are establishing the invariant, and they take `\r`, the bidi controls and the
  line separators out of the same input without a word either. Closes #1808.
- test(content): **the literal codec's stray-slot drop is stated.**
  `from_plaintext` filters `ISLAND_SLOT` out of its input and nothing failed if
  the filter went: `into_normalized` normalizes but does not validate, and the
  mint does not repair a stray slot, so the codec would have handed out a
  `Normalized` that `validate` refuses. The markdown door's half of the contract
  landed with #1812; this is the other one. Closes #1810.
- test(core,content,typst,pdf): **each property suite lives beside the seam it
  states, and `quillmark-fuzz` is gone.** Seven targets over boundaries owned by
  four crates sat in one `publish = false` member outside `default-members`, so
  a bare `cargo test` ran none of them, and `quillmark_typst::emit` stayed a
  `#[doc(hidden)] pub` module for a single out-of-crate import. Each is now a
  `properties` module beside its owner's unit tests: coercion under
  `quill/tests/`, the resting form under `quill/conform/tests/`, `Document`'s
  JSON and markdown doors under `document/tests/`, the content decode lanes in
  `content/tests/properties.rs`, the escapers inside `emit.rs`'s own test module
  — where they share the `resolve` oracle they had been carrying a second copy
  of — and the stamp spine's byte reads in `quillmark-pdf/tests/`. `emit` is
  private, and the saved regression seeds move to the paths proptest derives
  from the new sources. Closes #1684.
- test(core,typst,content): **the property targets that could not fail are
  stated so they can.** `fuzz_emit_roundtrip_arbitrary` drew `\PC{0,1000}` and
  round-tripped what parsed, but `Document::parse` refuses any source without a
  `$quill` root block: 0 of 2000 draws reached the assertion. The body is now
  drawn under a spelled root block, where all 3000 do, and the property is that
  the loop settles — richtext's markdown is a lossy projection, so a first pass
  may move marks a second pass leaves alone; the shaped generators keep the
  identity. `fuzz_escape_string_injection_safety` scanned escaped output for
  three literal substrings its own generator draws once in ~10^15 cases, and
  would have failed a correct escaper if it ever had: it and its raw-quote twin
  are one property that parses the literal back with Typst and asserts the
  authored characters. The `CardWire` sweep gains the spelled envelope that the
  storage sweep already had, so every case reaches `Card::try_from` and the
  generator-reach guard it needed is gone. Deleted outright: the wide-payload
  loop (`spec_conformance_probe` pins the cap, and now the width it admits) and
  the three `1..20`-deep markdown loops, which approach no boundary —
  `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` is 100, and content pins that.
- docs(canon): **the stamp spine names both of its consumers.**
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` described `quillmark-pdf` as leaf infrastructure consumed
  by `quillmark-pdfform`. The Typst backend consumes it unconditionally — the
  fields a plate's `form-field` calls place go through the same `stamp` — and
  nothing under `crates/backends/typst/src/` is feature-gated, so a reader
  following canon concluded a Typst quill's form fields come from the pdfform
  backend, and settling #1640 took a read of three manifests. The sentence
  now names the layer and both consumers, meeting at `&[FieldSpec]` and never
  each other. Closes #1749.
- ci(release): **the version arithmetic and changelog baseline are tested
  scripts.** `release-prepare.yml`'s `Compute next version` block runs only when
  a maintainer dispatches it, and one release candidate exists in the
  repository's history, so a defect in its `-rc.N` branches would surface at the
  release that needed them. The block moves to `scripts/next-version.sh`, taking
  the dispatch inputs verbatim so the workflow step holds no conditional of its
  own, and the changelog baseline's pre-release skip moves to
  `scripts/last-release-tag.sh`, reading a tag list on stdin so a test feeds it
  fixtures rather than a repository. `scripts/release-prepare.test.sh` covers
  twenty cases in ci.yml's lint job beside the canon spine lint: an
  override taken verbatim and one already carrying `-rc.N` left unsuffixed,
  iteration counting `rc.9` to `rc.10` rather than concatenating, promotion
  dropping the suffix at any N while ignoring `bump`, a minor bump zeroing the
  patch, and a pre-release tag passed over for the final beneath it. Covering it
  found the defect it was written for: a `bump` outside `patch` and `minor`, and
  a `CURRENT` no branch can shape — a `0.93.1-beta.1` an earlier free-text
  override left behind, whose arithmetic fails to stderr without failing the
  shell — each left the version empty and exited 0, and the workflow
  interpolated that empty string into `cargo release version`, the release
  branch name, the tag and the changelog heading. A version the arithmetic
  cannot compute is a refusal now. A 160-combination sweep of the original block
  against the script shows no other difference. Closes #1767.
- build(wasm): **the package build reads its version without jq.** `jq` was a
  hard prerequisite of `build-wasm.sh` for one string: the version out of `cargo
  metadata`. `cargo pkgid` carries the number the crate inherits from
  `version.workspace`, and stripping past the last `#`, `@` or `:` reads every
  pkgid spelling cargo has used, since a semver holds none of the three. The
  guard is a semver match, so an unparseable pkgid fails the build rather than
  stamping a partial string; `--release-stamp` still stamps verbatim, which is
  what `release.yml` compares against the tag before publishing. The
  `pkg/.gitignore` the script wrote goes — the root `.gitignore` already ignores
  `pkg/`, and `package.template.json`'s `files` allowlist is what decides the
  published set — and so does the brotli line in the size report, a second
  compressor for a second number nothing acts on which printed only where it
  happened to be installed. The core artifact's one remaining gzip pass feeds
  both the report line and the size budget, which were compressing the same
  8.7 MB twice. Closes #1766.
- test(core): **`quillmark:blank_title` rides the transform schema, and only
  it.** The keyword labels the blank that leads an enum's wire-valid domain and
  had no test anywhere, so a rename or a drop shipped silently. The label and
  the blank are asserted as one object, the label being meaningless without the
  blank it names: a field carrying `ui.blank_title` emits both, a field without
  it emits the domain and no key at all. Whole-object equality, so an
  unconditional key emitting `""` reads as a failure rather than passing a
  presence check. The declaration view keeps emitting `values:` verbatim —
  injecting the blank there would emit `values: ["", …]`, which
  `quill::enum_blank_member` rejects, so a quill round-tripping through that
  view would stop loading. Closes #1765.
- test(wasm): **the typed write and resolve suites run on the gated surface.**
  `runtime/runtime.js` patches `writer` and `reader` onto the core build's
  `Quill`, and `basic.test.js` drives the typst backend build — a different
  class over different memory, where those verbs do not exist. That is why its
  typed-commit and resolve suites reached for the `_`-prefixed `_commitField`
  and `_resolve`: the front door was not there to reach. Both move to
  `runtime.test.js`, where the gated surface is what a consumer holds, and no
  underscored call remains in either file. Five assertions `runtime.test.js`
  already made through `writer.set` and `writer.card(i).set` go. Ten had no
  public twin and carry over: `edit::field_coercion_failed` and
  `edit::field_not_inline`, which appeared nowhere else in the suite; the
  `DocPath` a refused write anchors to; `setAll`'s all-or-nothing abort at both
  the unknown-name and the coercion rung; `CardWriter.setAll`; and resolve's
  declaration-order rows, its `default` and `blank` rungs, and `body` as a
  sibling of `fields`. Six tests filed under the typed-commit title never
  touched that ABI — they drive `applyChange` and `mapMarks` — and are retitled
  where they sit. The foreign-module fixture copies the core build into an
  `mkdtemp` directory and removes it in `afterAll`, where it wrote `pkg/dup-core`
  and cleared it at the *next* run's start: a unique path per run cannot collide
  with a concurrent one, and a leak lands in the OS temp directory rather than
  in a build directory. Closes #1764.
- test(quillmark): **the quiver sweeps share one walker and one loaded quiver.**
  `quillmark_fixtures::quill_names` is the single list of fixture quills,
  counting a directory when `quills_path` resolves it to a bundle carrying
  `Quill.yaml` — the versioned layout every fixture uses, which neither of the
  two bare `is_dir()` walkers knew about. The seed sweep joins the
  empty-document and blueprint sweeps in `quiver_test.rs` over one `LazyLock`
  quiver, so each quill loads once for all three rather than once per sweep and
  the three run in parallel inside one binary: fifteen loads become five, two
  engines become one, and the sweeps finish in 272 ms where the two binaries
  took 678 ms. All three documents stay, none subsuming another — the blueprint
  commits every `default:` and marks every defaultless cell `!must_fill`, the
  seed commits every `example:` and omits every defaulted field, and only the
  empty document carries no composable card. Closes #1763.
- docs(bindings,migrations): **the parity table records differences; the
  migration index records steps.** `BINDINGS.md`'s table drops the six rows
  whose class was `identical`, which now read as one line above it, and three
  rows stop restating the model the section states 90 lines up. What the table
  holds is one row per forced difference. The migration index cuts each row to
  the step's headline break, from 3,729 words of table cells to 594 for the
  whole page: a chooser, not a fifth copy of each guide beside the commit, the
  changelog and the guide itself. The one storage-format move across the
  thirteen steps (0.111 → 0.112) is stated once in the preamble. Closes #1701.
- docs: **the twenty pre-0.100 migration guides leave the published site.**
  `wasm-0.77-to-0.80.md` through `0.99-to-0.100.md` and the `0.92-to-0.102.md`
  span guide go, with their rows in the Migration overview: 5,519 lines routing
  a consumer onto `RenderSession`, `` ```card `` fences, `QUILL:` frontmatter,
  `$id` and `!fill`, none of which any release since 0.100 carries in any form.
  What keeps a pre-0.100 stored blob loading is the reader in
  `crates/core/src/document/dto.rs`, specified in
  `prose/canon/DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md`; no guide was ever load-bearing for it.
  `mkdocs.yml` states the nav exclusion as `/migrations/*.md`, one line in
  place of the 33 a release had to extend.
- docs(core): **`ERROR.md`'s args table covers the three `validation::seed_*`
  codes it claimed.** The table is the `code` + `args` consumer contract, and
  `diagnostic_args_match_canon` holds it to the minted set — but
  `seed_unknown_kind`, `seed_overlay_shape` and `seed_unknown_field` were
  missing from both, so the two agreed by omitting the same three. The rows are
  minted from the overlay walk itself, on a document that trips all three.
- docs(core,wasm): **`PREVIEW.md` points at the two surfaces it was copying.**
  § "The seam" claimed every `SessionHandle` method past `render` and
  `page_count` defaults to *absent* and that a backend's capabilities are
  exactly the defaults it overrode. `field_at` breaks both: its default
  hit-tests whatever `regions()` returns, so overriding `regions` alone buys a
  working `field_at`. The section says what the seam is and leaves the
  per-method contract to `crates/core/src/session.rs`. § "TypeScript surface"
  loses its 62-line transcription of `runtime.d.ts`, which carries more
  per-member contract than the copy did and is the file `npm run typecheck`
  checks.
- docs(content,core): **the authored lane is `overwrite` and the op wire.**
  Canon and the 0.112 guide also named `install`, gone since 0.102, and
  `CardInput.body`, which has never rejected anything the storage lane takes.
  The card wire decodes storage-lane (`wire::body_from_wire` through
  `Codec::decode_field`) and owes that: every `Card` a read hands back is typed
  a valid `CardInput`, and a read emits a stored-only tolerance verbatim.
  `card_wire_body_decodes_storage_lane` pins the door's lane, which had drifted
  across canon, a released guide and four code comments with nothing catching
  it.
- fix(docs): **the 57 comments and doc claims that contradicted the code now
  state it.** The user-visible ones: the Typst backend never searched system
  fonts, so its docs stop promising `#set text(font: "Arial")` and name what a
  world loads (`assets/fonts/*`, `packages/**`, the embedded Figtree fallback);
  the quickstart teaches `quill.parse`, the bound door, rather than the
  transport door; `@quillmark/wasm` has no `/runtime` subpath, and the seven
  places that named one now spell the package's sole export.
- docs(wasm,typst,core): **the live session's edit verb is `update` in prose
  too.** The `@quillmark/wasm` README and the `LiveSession` rustdoc named an
  `apply(doc)` the class does not carry, so a consumer following them reached
  `session.apply is not a function`. The README also called `pageCount` and
  `pageSize(page)` stable for the session's lifetime, which a committed
  `update` invalidates: they read the current compile, the new count is
  `ChangeSet.pageCount`, and every page in `ChangeSet.dirtyPages` needs its
  `pageSize` re-read.
- docs: **two copies that were copies, not two ends of a subject.**
  `prose/README.md` divides canon and `docs/` by audience and says neither
  restates the other. § "Addressing cards for re-render" was in both, code
  block included; canon keeps the rule and points at the page that carries the
  recipe. The text-type 2×2 table was in `creating-quills.md` and
  `quill-yaml-reference.md`, with the tutorial already linking at the
  reference; the tutorial keeps the two questions that pick a type.
- docs(canon): **the crate compatibility position, and the third reading of an
  unknown content name.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Crate Structure" carries what the
  withdrawn `COMPATIBILITY.md` left unstated: seven crates publish to crates.io
  and promise no API stability before 1.0. Cargo reads a `0.x` minor bump as a
  major and the workspace bumps nearly every release, so there is no compatible
  release for `#[non_exhaustive]`, a sealed `Backend` or a `semver-checks` gate
  to hold — all three are the 1.0 tag's decisions, and a removal, a rename or a
  dependency's type in a public signature escapes all three regardless.
  `ERROR.md`'s YAML boundary rests on that promise. `DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md`
  § "Content vocabularies" weighed projecting an unknown name and dropping it,
  and now weighs carrying it opaquely while refusing only to project it: that
  holds the bytes and costs totality.
- test(fixtures): **`classic_resume` and `cmu_letter` leave the fixture tree.**
  2.7 MB of the 4.3 MB was their fonts. No test named `cmu_letter`;
  `classic_resume` was named by one three-line gate that also runs on `taro`
  and `usaf_memo`, and by the usage line of `print_blueprint`. What they
  exercised beyond the other five is covered without them: `body.enabled:
  false` by `sample_form` and `richtext_form`, a templated `ui.title` by
  `core/src/quill/tests.rs`, an object-typed schema by `address_grammar.rs` and
  `default_values_test.rs`. The `quillmark-fixtures` crate is `publish =
  false`, so nothing outside the workspace read them.
- test(wasm): **the `run_in_browser` test file goes; what it looked like it
  covered is covered by suites that run.** `tests/wasm_bindings.rs` held nine
  `#[wasm_bindgen_test]` cases and no runner — nothing under `.github/`,
  `scripts/` or `.cargo/` names wasm-pack or a browser harness, and `cargo test
  --workspace` compiles the file and runs zero tests out of it. Every assertion
  it made is made by a suite that does run. One was uncovered — `seedCard` on
  an undeclared kind answering `undefined` rather than throwing — and
  `core.test.js` now asserts it. `wasm-bindgen-test` leaves the
  dev-dependencies with the file.
- fix(fuzz): **the wide-payload property requires the parse to succeed and to
  keep every field.** `fuzz_decompose_large_payload` swallowed a parse `Err`
  and asserted `payload().len() <= size`, a bound `Payload::len` cannot exceed,
  so a parse that refused the input or dropped every field passed. It expects
  the parse and pins `len() == size`.


## v0.112.0 - 2026-09-01

- feat(content)!: **every vocabulary member spells its payload in `attrs`.** The
  canonical content had two spellings for one thing: a built-in put its payload
  in named siblings (`{"kind":"heading","level":1}`), an unknown put it in one
  opaque bag, and which a document used depended on whether the build that wrote
  it happened to know the name. Promoting a name from unknown to built-in was
  therefore an encoding change, and five mechanisms existed to bridge the split.
  Now `Heading{level}` ⇄ `attrs.level`, `Code{lang}` ⇄ `attrs.lang`, `Link{url}`
  ⇄ `attrs.url`, `Anchor{id}` ⇄ `attrs.id`, and `ListItem`'s
  `ordered`/`start`/`ordinal` ⇄ the same three under `attrs`, with the envelope
  keys (`kind`/`type`/`container`, `containers`, `continues`, `start`/`end`,
  `instance`) staying siblings and an empty bag omitted. The Rust types are
  unchanged — typed in memory, uniform on the wire. `fold_legacy_attrs`, the
  `reject_*_attrs` family, `MarkKind::ord` and its placement rule, and
  `RESERVED_*`'s wire role are all deleted; the canonical mark tie-break becomes
  `MarkKind::sort_key`, the `(type, attrs)` pair the wire carries, which two
  builds compute identically whether or not either knows the member. **Stored
  documents need no migration**: the decoder reads the old spelling wherever the
  `attrs` bag is absent. That is the load-bearing half — a `richtext` field
  rests as a content object inside an opaque payload value carrying no schema
  tag, so most stored content reaches no migration and a walk cannot safely find
  it (`$ext` is arbitrary host data by contract). The fallback is frozen: unlike
  the fold, a promotion neither grows it nor inherits it. The **break is at the
  seam**: a host reading `line.level` / `line.lang` / `mark.url` / `mark.id` or a
  list item's shape reads them under `attrs` (the TS narrowing types move too, so
  `typecheck` reports it), and the authored lane — `overwrite`, `install`,
  `CardInput.body`, and the op wire — *rejects* the old spelling rather than
  reading it, so a stale write throws instead of landing somewhere it did not
  aim. A foreign bag beside a built-in becomes legal in exchange, dropping unread
  as it always did in effect. Canonical bytes move (`attrs` on built-ins, and
  coincident marks reorder on the new tie-break), so **content hashes recompute
  once**; generated Typst nests coincident wraps the other way for identical
  glyphs, and `exportMarkdown` nests them the same way (`**~~x~~**` becomes
  `~~**x**~~`, parsing back to the same content), so goldens and any hash over
  either projection move too. A consumer holding bare seam JSON outside a
  stored document gets a hard break, having no tag to dispatch on. The storage
  tag becomes `quillmark/document@0.112.0`; `@0.93.0` rows migrate forward on
  read. See [0.111 → 0.112](docs/migrations/0.111-to-0.112.md).
- feat(core)!: **`fieldAt` and `positionAt` take a pointer tolerance, and
  resolve to the nearest ink rather than the first containing it.** A glyph's
  box is its run's ink height by its own advance, so a text column answers over
  a fraction of the area it occupies: the boxes of one line abut, but the
  leading between two lines is inside the paragraph and on no glyph. An 11pt
  paragraph is live over about two thirds of its own height at default leading
  and under half of it double-spaced, which is the whole of why clicking the
  preview to place a caret misses. Both queries now take `tol` in PDF points
  (`tolPt`, optional, on the WASM seam) and answer with the nearest placement
  within it, a radius in both axes. The caller derives it from the scale it drew
  the page at, slack being a property of the pointer rather than of the
  document: a tolerance fixed in points shrinks under the cursor exactly as the
  target does. Ranking by distance rather than growing each rect is what keeps
  the answer the nearer item's — outset boxes overlap, and a first match over
  them decides by paint order — and makes the tolerance a pure widening:
  containment is distance zero, so no point that resolves exactly changes answer
  however high `tol` goes, and later-painted still wins a tie.
  `RenderedRegion::distance` is the measure, and `contains` is now stated in
  terms of it. The break is the added argument on
  `SessionHandle::{field_at,position_at}` and their `LiveSession` forwarders,
  which a type checker reports; `0.0` is the previous behaviour exactly. The
  WASM argument is optional and defaults to `0`, so no JS caller changes.
- fix(content): **markdown export escapes what markdown strips at a line's
  edges.** A line's leading and trailing space/tab crossed verbatim, so
  `from_markdown(to_markdown(rt))` dropped it — and where the leading run
  opened an indented code block, or hid a `- ` / `# ` / `> ` / `N. ` marker
  from the position-0 escapes, the re-import rewrote the line's kind and
  containers with it: `"    foo"` returned as `"foo"` under `Code`, and
  `"   - item"` as `"item"` inside a `ListItem` nobody wrote. Neither takes
  adversarial input, since `apply_text_delta` and `from_plaintext` both mint
  edge whitespace: a `Codec::Plaintext` field holding an indented sample was
  corrupted by `Document::to_markdown`. The verify-and-drop net could not catch
  it, being gated on flanking marks — a mark-free line never reaches it, and
  the `,…,` probe wrapping the lines that do blocks every leading-block
  construct by design, so it reads such a line as safe while the `**` ships
  into the text. Space and tab at an edge now cross as character references
  (`&#32;` / `&#9;`), markdown having no backslash escape for whitespace. A
  literal `&` still escapes, so text authored as `&#32;` returns as itself. An
  image `alt` is the one edge run a reference cannot carry — the parser trims
  alt after decoding it — and joins the module's documented codec limits.
  Emitted markdown moves for content holding an edge run.
- fix(content): **a `=` run on a continuation line stays text.** It underlined
  the paragraph line above it into a setext heading, taking the hard break's
  `\` into the text with it: `"abc\n==="` returned as an H1 reading `"abc\"`.
  `\=` joins the block starters escaped at position 0.
- fix(content): **an unknown island's type cannot leave its placeholder.**
  `emit_island` wrote `island_type` — an open wire string no lane constrains —
  raw into `<!-- island:… -->`, where a `-->` closes the comment early and a
  line break ends the HTML block, either way leaking the rest as content text.
  At column zero that opens whatever the rest spells, a `~~~` card fence
  included, which the document layer reads as another card. The type crosses
  with `<` / `>` as entities and control characters as spaces; nothing reads it
  back out of markdown.
- fix(content): **an inline unknown island keeps its line whole.**
  `fix_html_comment_fences` inserted a newline after any `-->` carrying text
  behind it, but only a comment opening a line — at most three spaces of indent
  — starts an HTML block. One reached mid-line is inline HTML and swallows
  nothing, so an inline island turned `ab` into `"a b"`. The repair fires for
  the block-opening case alone.
- fix(core): **the payload ingresses refuse what no parse can produce.** The
  wire `TryFrom`, the storage DTO and `push_card` / `insert_card` each admitted
  a payload whose markdown does not read back: a duplicate field key, more
  fields than `MAX_FIELD_COUNT`, a repeated `$` entry, a comment whose text
  spans lines, and a composable card carrying `$quill` or `$seed`. The comment
  is the one that fails quietly — `#` opens a single line, so a text of
  `"hi\ninjected: pwned"` emits bare YAML after the first line and re-reads as
  a field nobody wrote. The rest emit markdown the parser rejects, and a
  composable `$quill` also trips the `debug_assert` in `from_main_and_cards`,
  which the rebuild behind `compile_data` runs: a render panicked on a debug
  build where it owed an error. `PayloadViolation` carries the verdict —
  `FieldViolation`'s seam one level up, reading the item list rather than one
  item — which the wire maps to `WireError::InvalidPayload` and the DTO to
  `StorageError::Malformed`, so both boundaries share one message. The
  `$quill` / `$seed` half is positional, since a `CardWire` is equally how the
  main card is read back, so it sits at placement beside the `$kind` gate as
  `EditError::RootOnlyEntry` (`edit::root_only_entry`). The DTO refuses a root
  `$kind` other than `main` and synthesises an absent one, as the parser does.
  Additive: `validate_payload`, `PayloadViolation`, `MetaKey::ALL`. Both error
  enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`, so no compiling caller changes, and no
  document the format calls readable is refused.
- fix(cli): **`render -f svg` / `-f png` writes every page.** The Typst backend
  emits one artifact per page and the command wrote `artifacts.first()`,
  discarding the rest with no warning, so a multi-page document produced a
  single-page file that looked complete. A multi-page render now writes one
  numbered file per page: `out.svg` becomes `out-1.svg`, `out-2.svg`, ….  Page
  one is numbered too, so no unnumbered file claims to be the whole document.
  `--stdout` carries one artifact and refuses a multi-page render.
- fix(core): **a `!must_fill` marker on a mapping is refused at every ingress,
  not just at parse.** `Card::store_fill`, the `CardWire` boundary and the
  `@0.92.0` storage DTO took `fill: true` against an object and emitted
  `x: a: 1`, which `Document::parse` then refuses — breaking the emit round
  trip. The rule the parser enforces now sits beside the other field invariants
  as `edit::validate_fill_targets`, raising `edit::fill_on_mapping`. A canonical
  content object stays legal: emit projects it to its markdown scalar first,
  which is the shape `!must_fill` emits against.
- fix(core): **a comment after a nested key that needs quoting keeps its
  position.** A comment's position is its index among its mapping's children,
  and the prescan matched only a bare `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` nested key. So
  `"a b": 1`, which the emitter writes itself, was not counted, and every comment
  after it in that mapping round-tripped one slot early. The prescan reads a
  nested key in both spellings the emitter writes at depth: quoted, and plain
  with characters the bare form excludes.
- fix(pdfform): **an array-bound text widget is multiline.** `resolve::coerce_text`
  joins an array's elements with newlines unconditionally while the widget took
  `multiline` from `ui`, defaulting to false: a viewer collapsed the `/V` at its
  first line while the flattened SVG/PNG stacked every line, so the interactive
  PDF and the raster disagreed.
- fix(core): **a version segment is plain digits, and a `$quill` `@` carries a
  selector.** `u32::from_str` accepts a leading `+`, so `memo@+2.+1` parsed as
  `Minor(2, 1)` and `version: "+1.0"` loaded, though `quill_ref_hint` promises
  digits and neither spelling re-`Display`s to itself; and `memo@` yielded an
  empty selector silently read as `latest`. An absent selector still means
  latest.
- fix(core): **an unquoted numeric `version:` keeps its fraction.** The loader
  accepts a YAML number by intent but converted it through `f64::to_string`,
  which drops the fraction: `version: 1.0` became `"1"` and failed validation
  with a hint naming the `'1.0'` the author had written. An unquoted `1.10` is
  the YAML number `1.1` before the loader sees it, so VERSIONING.md's quote-it
  rule now names that rather than the `x.0` case.
- fix(python): **a value with no JSON form raises instead of storing its
  `repr`.** `py_to_json_at` fell through to `str()`, so a tuple stored
  `"('a', 'b')"`, a `bytes` stored `"b'...'"` and a `set` stored `"{'x'}"` —
  silently, surfacing as garbage at render or read-back. `datetime.date`,
  `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.time` keep the stringified form the
  fallback existed for; everything else is a `ValueError`, which is what the
  WASM lane already refuses.
- fix(python): **the type stub declares `Diagnostic.args`**, the localization
  channel the class exposes. Under a type checker `diag.args` was an attribute
  error on a `@final` class.
- docs(python): **the error contract names both classes the binding raises.**
  `errors.rs` claimed every raised exception is `QuillmarkError` carrying
  diagnostics, while an argument the binding cannot convert raises `ValueError`
  — the behavior the binding's own tests pin. Engine refusals carry diagnostics;
  an unconvertible argument raises `ValueError` before the engine is called.
  Stated in the module doc and in the error-handling guide.
- fix(wasm): **`new Document(ref)` refuses an invalid reference with the code
  and hint `setQuillRef` attaches.** The same input was classified two ways by
  one binding: `parse::invalid_quill_reference` plus the canonical grammar hint,
  or a bare message. Both doors mint it through one helper now.
- fix(typst): **a literal `;` after emitted inline markup survives to the
  page.** Typst's markup parser reads a semicolon directly after an embedded
  code expression as that expression's terminator and renders nothing, so
  ``Use `--force`; otherwise`` lowered to `#raw("--force"); otherwise` and
  dropped the character. `continues_expr` guarded `(` and `.ident` for the same
  reason; it guards `;` now, and the emitter writes the same `\` before it.
- fix(typst): **document text reaches the page as the characters it holds, not
  Typst's substitutions for them.** `escape_markup` escaped `~`, whose lexer
  shorthand is a non-breaking space, and left the rest of that class active:
  `pages 3--5` rendered an en dash, `wait...` an ellipsis, `-5` a minus sign,
  and `-?` an invisible soft hyphen, taking both authored characters off the
  page. A mark decided it too, since Typst reads the text behind one as a fresh
  token: `x-5` stayed literal but `**x**-5` lowered to `#strong[x]-5`, a minus
  sign the content never held. Each shorthand's head is escaped now, which is
  enough — what one leaves behind is too short to re-form it. **Smart quotes
  stay.** `'` and `"` are an element with a set rule, not a lexer shorthand, so
  a quill picks its own typography with `#set smartquote(enabled: false)`; the
  emitter escaping them would settle that for every quill with no way back.
  Documents holding a dash pair, an ellipsis or a signed number render
  differently.
- fix(typst): **an island that renders as nothing no longer joins the text
  either side of it.** An island type this build does not know, and an empty
  table island, emit no markup, so the two text runs their slot separated abut
  in the output — where the escapers, which run per text run, see one side of
  the join at a time. `a/`, such an island, `/b` wrote `a//b`: a Typst comment
  that swallowed the rest of the paragraph. The emitter guards that seam with
  the same `\` it writes at a line anchor and an expression tail.
- fix(typst): **the caret one past a field's last character resolves to the last
  glyph, not the paragraph's first.** `Scan::locate` admits the end position but
  `forward_pos` matched runs half-open, so the most common caret position while
  typing fell through to the segment's generated start. A position no run
  contains now resolves against the nearest preceding run.
- fix(typst): **a vendored package whose manifest declares a non-semver
  `version` or an unusable `entrypoint` path warns instead of failing the
  session.** Both aborted `QuillWorld::new` even when the plate never imports
  that package, where an unparseable manifest, an unusable asset path, and a
  missing entrypoint already warn and carry on. A non-semver `version` skips the
  package; an unusable `entrypoint` path keeps the files already loaded and
  skips only the check that the entrypoint is among them.
- fix(wasm): **`RenderResult` crosses a diagnostic's `args` as the
  `Record<string, unknown>` it declares.** It returns through tsify's ABI, whose
  default serializer emits a `Map` for a map-typed field, where every
  hand-serialized diagnostic path passes `serialize_maps_as_objects(true)`.
  `RenderResult.warnings` puts the document's parse warnings ahead of the
  render's own, and a `plate::unsupported_construct` parse warning carries
  `args`: a quill declining a construct its body still holds renders
  successfully, and `args.construct` read back `undefined`. `RenderResult` and
  `Diagnostic` declare `hashmap_as_object`, and a `const` assertion holds each
  to it.
- fix(content): **a table island whose `aligns` or a row is not an array
  normalizes to one the store can reload.** `normalize_table_props` repaired a
  non-array `header` but fell through for the other two, while `table_shape_error`
  read them as width 0 — so an island op carrying `{"aligns": "bogus"}` was
  accepted and serialized, and the exact bytes then failed to reopen with
  `TableAlignsMismatch`. Normalizing a table now makes its shape check pass, as
  `KnownIslandType::normalize_props` promises.
- fix(content): **a code block's `lang` is reduced to an identifier on the
  storage lane and refused on the authored one.** `sanitize_lang` ran on import
  only, so the storage decode and the `setKind` op wire took any string and
  `emit_code` wrote it onto the fence header verbatim: a `lang` of
  `"rust\ninjected line"` exported a content line the document never had, and a
  backtick made the fence illegal. The storage decode sanitizes, so a blob
  written that way still opens; the authored wire raises a shape error, since
  the host is writing now and the repair would be silent.
- fix(core): **a variant-bearing enum refuses a non-string `default:` at load,
  as a plain enum already does.** The scalar branch applied the render floor's
  leniency to a schema literal, so `default: 1` against `values: ["1"]` loaded
  clean and then selected nothing: `selected_member`, `resolve_variant_sourced`
  and the absent-discriminant fallback all read the default through `as_str`, so
  the field compiled to the blank world instead.
- fix(core): **a seeded variant container commits at its resting form.**
  `seed_parts` runs every other field through the strict write, but
  `seed_variant` pushed its assembled container straight through, so a `$seed`
  overlay for a richtext cell rested as raw markdown and the next `conform`
  rewrote bytes on a document nobody edited — the divergence the shared write
  exists to prevent.

## v0.111.0 - 2026-08-30

- feat(wasm): **`mapMarks(content, bundle)` answers where a `ChangeBundle`'s
  text-moving channels leave a field's marks**, the coordinates its `markOps`
  are written in. Each of `delta`, `islandOps` and `lineOps` rebases the marks
  already in the field — a range's `start` takes assoc `after` and its `end`
  `before`, a zero-width mark takes `before` — and that rule reached the
  boundary only as a comment on a private method, so an editor deciding which
  `markOps` to emit had to reimplement it, and one that read the range rule as
  the whole rule drifted an anchor a character on text typed at the anchor's own
  position. `Content::map_marks` and `Content::apply_field_change` walk one
  channel list, so the prediction and the store cannot answer a position
  differently, and the answer is normalized as the store's is, so a bundle
  carrying no `markOps` names the marks the field will hold. The rule is stated
  on `ChangeBundle` and in `BINDINGS.md`.

- fix(core): **a `plaintext` field declared `inline: true` keeps the flag on the
  declaration wire.** `FieldSchema::serialize` projected the flag back out of
  the type enum with a `RichText { inline: true }` match only, so
  `type: plaintext, inline: true` serialized as `{"type":"plaintext"}` — WASM
  `quill.schema()`, the Python binding, and the CLI `schema` command all lost
  the single-line constraint, and a serde round-trip degraded the field to
  `inline: false`.
- fix(core): **a comment on a CRLF line no longer carries its `\r` into the
  emitted document.** The prescan splits on `\n`, so a trailing- or own-line
  comment slice ran to end-of-line including the `\r`; it rode through the DTO
  and wire and was written back verbatim, against `to_markdown`'s "line endings:
  `\n` only". Field values were never affected. A `\r` *inside* a comment still
  reaches emit.
- fix(facade): **loading a path that names no directory says so.** The walk
  answered a missing root with an empty tree, so `quill_from_path("/typo")`
  failed later with `Quill.yaml not found in file tree`, pointing at the
  bundle's contents instead of the path. Python's `Quill.from_path` surfaced
  that directly; the CLI's pre-checks are gone but for `validate`'s
  missing-`Quill.yaml` one, gated on the directory existing so it names the
  bundle a real directory lacks without shadowing the loader's answer for a
  typo. `validate`'s load-failure summary names no file, that branch covering a
  missing directory too.
- fix(content): **`LineOp::SetKind` refuses a heading level outside `1..=6`.**
  The arm checked kind/text agreement but not the level, so a Rust caller could
  apply `Heading { level: 9 }` and leave a content whose `validate()` fails and
  whose export emits `#########` — read back as a literal-hash paragraph on the
  next import. The JSON wires already range-checked it. New
  `ApplyError::BadHeadingLevel`.
- fix(typst): **diagnostic columns count characters, not bytes.** Any multi-byte
  character earlier on the source line inflated the reported column, which an
  editor reads as a jump target.
- fix(pdf): **a non-finite widget `/Rect` is refused (`pdf::bad_rect`) rather
  than written.** `form.json` rect values deserialize as plain `f32` and
  saturate to `inf`, and `flip_rect` arithmetic can reach `NaN`; pdf-writer
  prints a non-finite float verbatim, so `stamp` returned `Ok` with `inf`/`NaN`
  tokens in the output — no PDF number grammar admits them. `flatten` guards the
  geometry it draws. Matches the posture `font_size` already took. `regions_of`
  is still unguarded.
- fix(pdf): **a base PDF that already carries an `/AcroForm` is refused
  (`pdf::existing_acroform`).** The catalog rewrite appended a second
  `/AcroForm` key without looking, leaving a dict the spec does not define and
  the old form's widgets live in the preserved page `/Annots`. Stripping was
  already the documented authoring rule; it is now checked.
- fix(pdf): **`fonts_used` registers only the faces a `/DA` names.** Only `Text`
  and `Choice` widgets write one, so a checkbox or signature spec carrying
  `Times`/`Courier` emitted an unreferenced Type1 object and a dead `/DR /Font`
  entry into every stamped PDF.
- refactor(core): the unreachable null arm in the `Date`/`DateTime` coercion is
  deleted (`conform_value` returns on any null before the type match), and
  `Version` derives the ordering its field order already spells.

## v0.110.0 - 2026-08-26

- **breaking** wasm: **the seam spells a container's `instance`, so the read
  type can require it and every write lane reports an omission.** 0.109 gave
  `Container` the discriminator that tells one container from an adjacent
  sibling of identical shape, and left it an obligation no checker asked for;
  the op lane got a requirement, the whole-`Content` lane — `overwrite`,
  `CardInput.body`, the one a codec flattening a tree writes through — did not.
  It could not: one encoder served storage and the bindings, writing the key
  only where it was non-zero, and a field a read may omit is a field a write
  cannot require. `serial::to_seam_value` is that encoder with every `instance`
  spelled, and the bindings take it on every lane typed `Content`
  (`reader.getContent{,At}`, `getStored` on a body, `importMarkdown`, `rebase`,
  and the card wire behind `document.main` / `cards` / `card(i)` / `removeCard`
  / `makeCard` / `seedMain` / `seedCard`). `ContentContainer.instance` becomes
  required, `ContentContainerInput` is deleted, and `LineOp.setContainers` takes
  `ContentContainer` — a net-smaller surface than 0.109's. The break is every
  hand-built container literal, which is the one a type checker does report.
  A checker still cannot report a `0` stamped on every run, which is the write
  that welds them: `assignInstances` is the rule, not the type. Storage keeps
  the omission and stored blobs re-encode byte for byte; so do the render lanes,
  and so does what the seam types `unknown` (`getStored` on a field,
  `PayloadItem.value`), which answers with the stored bytes verbatim. Content
  parsed from a stored document is the one shape that needs a cast.
  [Guide](docs/migrations/0.109-to-0.110.md)
- fix(core): **`Quill::validate` refuses only what the render floor refuses.**
  Validation ran its own read-side type dispatch over the authored value while
  the render door validated the *coerced* one, so five of seven types had values
  that rendered and were fatally `validation::type_mismatch` at once — a bare
  scalar for an `array`, `"3"` for an `integer`, `1` for a `boolean`, a
  length-1 array for a `string` or `date`. `airmark`'s `usaf_memo@0.2` declares
  `letterhead_caption` as an `array`, and the bare scalar a starter template
  spells it with — a valid spelling of a one-element list — audited as fatally
  invalid across every document seeded from it, each rendering correctly.

  `validate_value` now conforms each document value through `conform_value` at
  `Leniency::Render` before judging it, so a type has one predicate and **a
  fatal `validation::*` diagnostic means the document does not render**.
  Conforming runs per node, so one refused element no longer mistypes its
  siblings: `counts: [true, "abc"]` under `integer` items is one mismatch, at
  `counts[1]`. Two consequences for a consumer routing on codes: a value the
  floor adopts raises nothing where it previously raised
  `validation::type_mismatch`, and a bare scalar the floor stringifies into an
  `enum` field is now domain-checked on that string, so `grade: 5` against
  `values: [alpha, beta]` is `validation::enum_violation` where it was
  previously silent — the diagnostic the render door already raised. Schema
  literals (`example:`, `default:`) stay strict.

## v0.109.1 - 2026-08-24

- fix(typst): **a `field-region` claim around inline content no longer widens
  the line.** Each of the helper's two bracketing markers was written
  `#metadata(..) <__qm_region__>`, and the space before the label survived into
  the inline flow. It cost 2.715pt per marker at a 12pt body size, so a claim
  on a date or any mid-paragraph composition shifted the text around it by
  5.43pt, against the layout-neutral contract the helper documents.
  `form-field`'s marker carries the same shape and drops the space too, rather
  than keep depending on the `box` that follows it.

## v0.109.0 - 2026-08-24

- **breaking** content: **`Normalized` is the precondition the projections
  require, and every codec returns one.** A projection over a container tree
  owes totality, and `Content` alone does not say whether `normalize` has run —
  so `to_markdown` and `emit_content` each trusted a canonical shape their
  signature did not ask for. `Content::into_normalized` is the mint (infallible:
  canonicalizing is total, and the codecs go on calling `validate` after it),
  `Normalized::into_content` the way back out, and the token derefs to
  `&Content`, so **a read-only consumer needs no change** — `.text`, `.lines`,
  `.marks`, `.islands`, `validate()`, `is_inline()` all reach through. What
  moves is the signatures a caller names or a value it mutates:

  | Crate | 0.108 | 0.109 |
  |---|---|---|
  | `quillmark-content` | `from_markdown` / `from_plaintext` / `from_canonical_json` / `serial::from_canonical_value` / `serial::from_authored_value` → `Content` | → `Normalized` |
  | | `to_markdown(&Content)` | `to_markdown(&Normalized)` |
  | | `Content::to_canonical_json` | `Normalized::to_canonical_json` |
  | | `serial::to_canonical_value(&Content)` | `(&Normalized)` |
  | `quillmark-typst` | `emit::emit_content(&Content)` | `(&Normalized)` |
  | `quillmark-core` | `Card::body() -> &Content` | `-> &Normalized` |
  | | `Card::overwrite_body(Content)` / `overwrite_field(_, Content)` | `impl Into<Normalized>` — a `Content` still passes |
  | | `TypedReader::get_content{,_at}` / `CardReader::get_content{,_at}` → `Option<Content>` | `Option<Normalized>` |

  A consumer that *mutates* a decoded content takes the round trip, which is
  what the codecs used to run for it silently:

  ```rust
  // 0.108
  let mut rt = from_markdown(md)?;
  rt.marks.push(mark);
  rt.normalize();

  // 0.109
  let mut rt = from_markdown(md)?.into_content();
  rt.marks.push(mark);
  let rt = rt.into_normalized();
  ```

  The op channel needs none of that: `apply_text_delta`, `apply_mark_ops`,
  `apply_line_ops`, `apply_island_ops` and `apply_field_change` are forwarded on
  `Normalized` and re-establish the invariant on the error path as well as the
  success one. `to_plaintext` still takes `&Content` and reads a token through
  the deref, projecting `text` alone with no walk to make total.

- feat(content): **`quillmark_content::traverse` is where the container walks
  live**, `runs` (adjacent lines sharing one container instance at a depth),
  `items` (adjacent lines whose whole container is equal) and `segment` (a line
  plus the continuations at its own nesting). Five call sites across three
  crates had spelled these by hand, each with its own idea of when a run ends;
  `Span` and the walks are public so a consumer reading `Content.lines` groups
  them the way both projections and the quill census do.

- perf(content): **`serial::to_canonical_value` and `to_canonical_json` take a
  `Normalized`.**
  Both cloned the whole content and normalized the copy on every call, on a
  lane whose callers — the codecs, `Card::body`, the storage DTO — were already
  holding the canonical form. The token now carries that, so the serialize path
  spends an encode instead of a deep clone plus a repair pass. `to_canonical_json`
  moves from `Content` to `Normalized` with it; a caller holding a raw `Content`
  mints first, which is what the old body did for them silently.

- fix(core): **a document body that `validate` refuses is refused on write, not
  discovered on read.** `CanonicalContent`'s `Deserialize` parsed, normalized and
  validated; its `Serialize` validated nothing, and `Card::overwrite_body` takes a
  caller's content on the canonical-form token alone. A store could therefore
  accept bytes it could not read back. The serializer now validates too and fails
  with the invariant, at the boundary that cares and while the caller still holds
  the value that produced it.

- refactor(content): **the leaf-segment walk is one loop, not two.** `traverse`
  gains `segment` — the block-opening line plus every following one that
  continues it at the same nesting — and `export::emit_block` and the Typst
  emitter's `segment_end` both call it. The fifth duplicated traversal, the one
  #1364 did not list.

- fix(content): **`to_markdown` no longer aborts the process on a deeply nested
  content.** `Normalized` states that `normalize` has run, and `normalize`
  repairs where `validate` rejects: nothing about canonicalization brings a
  container path under `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH`, so a hand-built `Content` mints a
  token that `validate` refuses. `export::emit_block` recursed one frame per
  container level and overflowed the stack a few thousand levels down — a
  SIGABRT no caller can catch, against a Typst emitter that checks the depth up
  front and returns `EmitError::NestingTooDeep` for the same input. The walk is
  now an explicit frame stack, as `json_depth_exceeds` and the quill census
  already are, so the projection is total over every token its signature
  accepts. `Normalized`'s docs settle the half the newtype does not close: the
  token promises canonical, not valid — the mint stays infallible, the codecs go
  on calling `validate` after it, and a projection that takes one owes totality
  rather than trust. Only a Rust embedder hand-building a `Content` reaches the
  shape; every decode lane (`from_markdown`, `from_canonical_value`, storage,
  WASM, Python) rejects the depth already.

- fix(typst): **a container inside a list item no longer terminates the list.**
  The item's continuation indent reached its leaf path only, so a quote inside
  an item opened at column 0 — where Typst ends the enclosing list. The item's
  later blocks came back as top-level paragraphs and the next item started a
  fresh list, which renumbers an ordered one from the quote on. A fence and a
  nested list escaped it by reaching that indented leaf path; a transparent
  unknown container did not, and neither would any container added later.
  Indentation is now the walk's rather than each construct's: one rule opens
  every block, leaf and container alike, at the enclosing list depth, so what
  the content nests, the markup nests.

- fix(content): **a `continues` line that crosses a container boundary no longer
  survives.** A within-block break lives inside one container, and `LineOp::Join`
  mints the crossing shape whenever it merges two lines of differing paths — the
  line after the seam keeps continuing across it. Both projections already read
  the flag as dead there (`export::emit_block` and `emit::segment_end` each
  require the depth to match before absorbing a continuation), so `normalize`
  now clears it, which states what was already true and changes nothing
  observable. `Content::validate` gains `Invariant::ContinuesAcrossContainers`
  to catch a hand-built content that skipped `normalize`, and
  `LineOp::SetContinues` refuses the *deliberate* crossing up front with
  `ApplyError::ContinuesAcrossContainers` — the same repair-or-refuse split the
  line-kind rule already makes. This was the one relational line invariant
  nothing checked: `validate` is otherwise strictly per-line, while every
  container rule is a property of a line pair.

- fix(content): **two adjacent containers of one shape are no longer read as
  one.** Container identity is the container path plus contiguity, and the path
  carried nothing to tell one instance from the next, so two adjacent runs of
  equal shape welded: `[Quote], [Quote]` read as a single two-paragraph quote,
  and two one-item lists as a single item whose second line came back as an
  unnumbered continuation paragraph — the marker gone. `Container` now carries
  an `instance` discriminator on every arm, `Content::normalize` canonicalizes
  it to `0` (flipping to `1` only where the adjacent preceding run would
  otherwise weld), and the two projections read it. Four defects close with it:
  - `from_markdown("- a\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- b")` — the CommonMark idiom for
    spelling two lists apart — no longer destroys the second list's marker.
  - Two adjacent ordered lists typeset with their own numbering. They reached
    the Typst emitter as one run and `+` markers numbered the second list on
    from the first, so `1. 2.` / `1. 2.` rendered **1 2 3 4**. The run's first
    item now states its number, which resets Typst's running counter. Every
    ordered run's first item therefore lowers as `N. ` where a run starting at
    1 lowered as `+ `; the page is identical, the generated markup is not, so
    anything diffing or golden-comparing Typst source sees it.
  - `1. a` beside a list starting at `3` keeps that `start` through the
    Markdown projection. CommonMark reads only a list's first number, so
    `1. a\n\n3. b` re-imported as one list of two items and the `start` was
    lost — breaking the round-trip fixed point `export` documents. Adjacent
    lists now alternate their marker (`-`/`+`, `.`/`)`), which is how
    CommonMark itself spells two lists apart, so the boundary survives the
    projection with no comment marker in the authored file.
  - Adjacent `Unknown` containers of equal `(tag, attrs)` round-trip as two
    **through storage**, the lane they have: an unknown container has no
    Markdown syntax to alternate, so it projects transparently there as it
    always did. The open-set promise that a container this build does not know
    survives untouched is now total rather than holding up to an adjacency
    quotient.

  An item boundary is a parent boundary: two inner lists under two outer list
  items are two lists, so an inner run restarts its `ordinal` and needs no
  discriminator. `ordinal` is canonicalized alongside it, to a gapless 0-based index within
  its run, so `[5, 9]` and `[0, 1]` stop being two spellings of the same two
  items. `instance` is written to the wire only when non-zero, so a stored row
  that needs no discriminator — nearly all of them — keeps its exact bytes and
  its content hash. **Breaking for Rust consumers** that match `Container`
  exhaustively: `Quote` is now a struct variant, and `ListItem`/`Unknown` carry
  the extra field.

  On the TypeScript surface `instance` is optional — the wire omits a zero, so a
  read shape cannot require it — and nothing there stops compiling. A consumer
  that only reads needs no change. **A consumer that writes container paths owes
  the field**, which is every codec flattening a tree: two `bullet_list` nodes in
  a row are adjacent same-shape siblings, and omitting the discriminator lands
  them welded. Such a host keeps producing what it produced on 0.108, so the
  four defects above stay open for it until its codec stamps the discriminator.
  Nothing reports the omission. Two adjacent lines with equal paths are one
  container, which is also how a two-paragraph quote is spelled: the model
  cannot tell a boundary a writer meant from one it did not.

  The block census counts what the projections see, so two adjacent runs of one
  shape now count two where they counted one: a quill declining `list` or
  `quote` reports the construct at a document that has two of them where it
  reported one, and `plate::unsupported_construct` moves with it.

  A blob written here carries `instance` only where a document holds adjacent
  same-shape siblings, and a reader that predates the field ignores the key —
  so such a blob loads on 0.108 with the two runs welded, and re-saving there
  drops the boundary for good. A 0.109 host whose codec drops the key on
  write-back loses it the same way, with no version skew involved. The boundary
  is written by whatever produced the row — `from_markdown`, the CLI, any Rust
  caller — and survives only as far as the next writer that carries it.
  The `@0.93.0` tag is unchanged because every blob written before this release
  re-encodes byte for byte; the forward direction is the one that costs, and
  only for the documents that spend the key.

- fix(blueprint): **a variant's `object` or `array<object>` cell expands per
  property.** The cell went through the scalar path, so it rendered as
  `controlled_by: !must_fill # object` — a null where the schema wants a
  mapping, with every property's description, `default:` and type annotation
  dropped, and the marker on a path the obligation predicate never warns at.
  A cell is a field of its container and now expands as one, like every other
  surface already did.
- fix(core): **a `.quillignore` pattern holding more than one `*` ignores what
  it names.** The matcher handled exactly one wildcard and returned no match
  for the rest, so `**/*.tmp` and `*.sublime-*` were dead lines. Patterns now
  compile once through `glob::Pattern`, matched against the whole path and the
  basename. Two readings tighten to gitignore's: `*` stops at `/`, and a
  pattern spelling out a `/` anchors at the bundle root rather than matching
  any path that opens and closes with its halves. Both narrow what a line
  ignores, so a bundle can gain a file it used to drop: `assets/*` covers
  `assets/logo.png` and no longer `assets/icons/logo.png`, which `assets/**`
  or the directory line `assets/` covers. No in-tree quill spells either shape.
  A line always ignores the
  name it spells out as well: `[` opens a character class and is an ordinary
  character in a filename, so `Cinzel[wght].ttf` ignores both the variable font
  of that name and the class it describes.
- refactor: **`RenderError::coded(code, message)` is the one constructor for a
  single-error-diagnostic failure.** Nine sites across five crates spelled
  `from_diag(Diagnostic::new(Severity::Error, msg).with_code(code))` by hand,
  two of them as a per-crate `engine_err` helper the backends each carried
  their own copy of. Additive to `quillmark-core`'s public API; no code, message
  or shape changes.
- refactor(pdfform): **a session holds its flattened PDF parsed, not as bytes
  each render path reparses.** Flatten and parse now happen together in `open`
  and `update`, the two places `field_specs` are set, so the derived flat PDF
  moves only with the specs it comes from and `render_svg`/`render_png`/
  `render_rgba` paint parsed pages. A malformed flatten now surfaces from the
  call that produced it under one code, `pdfform::flat_parse_failed`, replacing
  the per-format `pdfform::svg_parse_failed` and `pdfform::png_parse_failed`
  raised at render time (neither documented, and both reachable only through a
  bug in this crate's own flatten). Opening a session fails on that bug now,
  including for a caller that only ever renders the AcroForm PDF, which is
  stamped from the base and reads nothing flattened.
- perf(pdf): **filling a PDF form no longer slows down with the size of its
  background or its page count.** Reading one object from the base walks every
  byte of it — the live copy is the last revision, so a scan cannot stop early
  — and nothing memoized that, so a stamp or flatten pass paid O(pages) whole-
  file scans and the live-edit path repaid them on every keystroke. The base's
  object offsets are now collected in one pass and each read is a lookup: a
  20-page 300 KB form stamps in 0.7 ms rather than 37 ms, flat in page count.

  **breaking** in `quillmark-pdf`: `PdfUpdate::begin` and
  `PdfUpdate::resolve_pages` take the `&ObjectIndex` the caller builds over the
  base rather than its bytes, and `reader::find_object_bytes` /
  `reader::object_dict` become `ObjectIndex::object_bytes` / `ObjectIndex::dict`.
- **breaking** content: the op wire is a reading direction. `mark_op_to_value`,
  `line_op_to_value` and `island_op_to_value` are removed from
  `quillmark-content` — an op bundle is authored on the JS/Python side and
  reaches Rust through `change_bundle_from_value`, so nothing in the workspace
  ever emitted one and every wire change was made twice, once in code no product
  path executes. The decoders are unchanged. Their round-trip tests become
  decoder tests over literal JSON, which is what the wire actually is: an
  encoder agreeing with its own reader never proved the shape a binding sends.
- perf(content): **canonical serialization stops rebuilding the tree it just
  built.** `to_canonical_value` normalized a copy — which already recursively
  key-sorts every opaque bag reachable from it (island `props`, an unknown's
  `attrs`) — and then ran a whole-tree `sort_keys_owned` over the encoded
  result, re-collecting and re-allocating every object and array in the document
  to reorder the handful of fixed keys the encoders insert themselves. The
  encoders now emit those keys in ascending order and the terminal pass is
  `canonicalize_keys`, which scans and returns when the tree is already
  canonical. Canonical bytes are unchanged, byte for byte; a tree that somehow
  arrives unsorted is still repaired rather than shipped.

  The public `container_to_value` and `mark_to_value`, and the crate-internal
  `island_to_value`, now emit their own keys in a different order. An unknown's `attrs` bag is
  untouched, as in 0.99, and nothing hashes the op wire.

## v0.108.3 - 2026-08-21

- fix(typst): **a paragraph holding one bare `/` renders instead of failing the
  compile.** Typst's heading `=`, list `-`/`+`/`N.`, and term `/` markers fire
  on a space after them *or* on the line ending there; the emitter's
  line-anchor guard tested only for the space, so a run that was one bare
  marker reached Typst unescaped — `/` as a term list whose colon is missing
  (`expected colon`), the other four as an empty heading, bullet or enum item.
  The guard now takes Typst's own test, and covers a list item's body head as
  well as column 0, that being a line start the parser reads as one.

- fix(typst): **bold text, a table cell or an indented paragraph opening with
  `-`, `=`, `+`, `/` or `N.` renders as that text.** Typst reads the head of
  every content block `[…]` as a line start of its own, so the marker in
  `**/ x**` or in a table cell reached it as a term list whose colon is missing
  and failed the compile, while `**- x**` drew a bullet list inside the bold.
  Indentation is trivia and holds that line start open behind it, so a
  paragraph beginning `  / x` failed the same way. The line-anchor guard now
  covers every position Typst reads as a line start.

- fix(typst): **text directly after inline code, bold or an image renders when
  it opens with `(` or `.name`.** Typst reads a `(` directly after a `#…`
  expression as that call's arguments and a `.` before an identifier as a field
  access, so the emitter's own `#raw(…)`, `#strong[…]` and `#image(…)` handed
  the text behind them to Typst as code — `` `x`(y) `` became a call on
  content, which fails the compile. Such a run now takes the same `\` prefix
  the line-anchor guard uses. Debug builds parse every emission with Typst's
  parser, so markup that reaches it as syntax fails a test rather than a render.

## v0.108.2 - 2026-08-20

- fix(core): **storage blobs tagged `@0.81.0` and `@0.82.0` load again.** Both
  tags migrate forward on read instead of failing as an unknown schema version.
  Migrations chain (`V0_81_0 → V0_82_0 → V0_92_0 → V0_93_0`); the write path is
  untouched, so re-serializing a migrated row emits `@0.93.0`.

  The `V0_82_0` hop is **lossy in one place**: the `$id` payload item is
  dropped, the live model having no counterpart for it. The alternative is
  refusing the row. A consumer that kept a key under `$id` re-establishes it
  under a `$ext` namespace it owns.

  This reverses the #929 retirement, whose two premises were both wrong. Rows
  do predate `@0.92.0` — #1327 reports stored `@0.81.0` ones. And `0.82.0` was
  not yanked: every published Quillmark version is live on crates.io, npm, and
  PyPI. Because no yank happened, `@0.82.0` names a shape
  union rather than a frozen format — every release from `0.83.0` through
  `0.91.0` stamped it — so the restored reader accepts the union (#1327)

- refactor!: **one definition per mechanism across the rust crates.** A
  whole-codebase simplify pass: the typst session compiles through one
  `recompile` pipeline whose derived tables (regions, span windows, page hashes)
  are built per commit instead of per query; the pdf reader's scan plumbing
  (`object_dict`, `open_trailer`, `dict_end`, `ws_end`) and the page-dict array
  splice are single definitions shared by stamp and flatten; the flattened PDF
  is shared by `Arc` instead of copied per render; emission, prescan, payload
  assembly and validation in core lose their duplicated dispatch and their
  per-keystroke deep clones. Two outputs shift: a blank pdfform document returns
  the base PDF unchanged rather than appending a revision carrying two
  unreferenced font objects, and three `quillmark-pdf` parse-failure messages
  share one `dict not parseable` spelling (codes unchanged). Dead public API is
  deleted: `FileTreeNode::{file_exists, dir_exists, list_files,
  list_subdirectories}`, `Payload::contains_key`, `PayloadItem::nested_comments`,
  `QuillValue::{string, integer, bool, null}` (the `From` impls and `from_json`
  are the constructors), `FieldSpec::{with_schema_field, with_value,
  with_tooltip}` (assign the fields), and `quillmark-content`'s
  `strip_bidi_formatting` / `fix_html_comment_fences` (internal to
  `normalize_markdown`). None had a caller in the workspace or bindings.

- fix: **an empty mapping emits as `{}` rather than losing its key.** `emit_field`
  dropped an empty-object field entirely, which composes with the block form of
  its parent into markdown no parser accepts: a `$ext` whose every namespace
  emptied wrote `$ext:` with no children, and re-parsed as null. That is the
  `parse::invalid_structure` a `@quillmark/svelte` host hit on save, once a
  tips-card dismissal had cleared `$ext.editor.tips`. One level down the same
  rule ran silent: `$ext` is the only slot type-checked, so an inner mapping
  turned null and the document parsed clean, handing a consumer back a type it
  never wrote. Plain user fields carried that loss too — `cfg: {opts: {}}`
  re-parsed as `cfg: null`, and the second emit then differed from the first.
  Empty mappings now emit `key: {}` at every depth. That is the spelling a
  sequence item (`- {}`) and a wholly empty `$ext: {}` already used, so an
  emptied container survives the round-trip as the value a consumer stored.

## v0.108.1 - 2026-08-19

- fix: **a content cell under `variants:` is readable at its codec.**
  `schema_at`, the walk behind `reader.get_content_at`, stepped `items` and
  `properties` where conform steps `variants` as well, so a key into a variant
  container fell to the catch-all and answered `edit::field_not_content` naming
  `enum` — for a cell the same config declares `plaintext`. Such a cell stored,
  conformed, seeded, validated and rendered, and nothing could read it back, so
  no consumer could mount a content editor over it. The walk unions the worlds,
  so a cell of a world that is not live reads absent rather than raising, as a
  stale row index does; a name no world declares is `edit::unknown_field`, and a
  variantless enum stays a scalar. The write is unchanged — a variant container
  has no per-cell op address and needs none, committing whole.

## v0.108.0 - 2026-08-18

- fix: **the value ladder is cut per cell, so the plate is total at every
  depth.** An absent container returned a value instead of descending, and
  everything below it was decided by that one branch: an absent `contact` never
  reached `contact.email`'s own `default:`, and a container `default: {name: A}`
  crossed whole, so a declared property it omitted was **missing from the
  plate** — a direct Typst read of it a compile error, on an address
  `form-field` still binds. Two spellings of the same state disagreed:
  authoring `contact: {}` rendered the leaf defaults that leaving `contact` out
  did not, and `default: {}` — documented as expanding to the blank-filled
  shape — emitted `{}` with no declared key at all. Resolution is now a descent:
  a rung supplies a *seed*, and the same composition runs over it whichever rung
  it came from, so absence is inherited rather than terminal and each cell cuts
  its own ladder. A partial element inside an `array` `default:` is completed
  against `items` as an authored element is. The variant container already
  worked this way and stops being the special case.
- **breaking** a `default:`/`example:` on an `object` with `properties` is a
  load error (`quill::default_on_namespace`, `quill::example_on_namespace`),
  naming the properties that hold it. A quill declaring one loaded before, so
  the upgrade reads as a quill that stopped loading rather than as a fix; no
  in-tree quill declares one. A typed dictionary is a namespace, not a cell:
  the container literal was a second declaration of a value the property
  already holds, and the two axes read different ones — `default: {name: A}`
  rendered `A` while `must_fill` derives per property and still reported `name`
  unauthored. It was also unchecked, so `default: {nope: 1}` loaded and crossed
  an undeclared key to the plate. This is the variant container's rule
  (`quill::default_type_mismatch`) generalized; an `array` keeps its literal,
  since `items:` fixes the element type but never the arity.
- **breaking** `must_fill:` is retired: obligation is a reading of `default:`,
  never a declaration of its own. Declaring the key is a load error
  (`quill::field_parse_error`) naming the migration that field's shape takes,
  `FieldSchema::must_fill()` is `default.is_none()`, and the raw
  `FieldSchema.must_fill` field is gone. Four of the five legacy declarations
  restate the derivation and migrate by **deletion**: `must_fill:` on a typed
  dictionary (a namespace carries no obligation — its leaves do), `must_fill:
  true` with no `default:`, and `must_fill: false` beside one. `must_fill:
  false` with no `default:` becomes `default: <the type's blank>` (`""`, `[]`,
  `0`, `false`) — already the corpus's most common `default:`. The fifth,
  `must_fill: true` beside a `default:`, is the one behavior deleted and the
  one judgment call: keep the `default:` to render the value unasked, or move
  it to `example:` to keep the ask. An example fills the blueprint cell the
  default vacated, seeds *carrying* the `!must_fill` marker where a
  `default:`-only field seeds nothing, and never renders — so an untouched
  document renders the blank rather than asserting a value nobody chose. For a
  `string` or `enum` the blueprint bytes are identical either way; three shapes
  are not. A `richtext` example never inlines, so its cell becomes a bare
  marker and the value survives only as the `# e.g.` hint. An
  `integer`/`number`/`boolean` blank is indistinguishable at the plate from an
  authored zero. On a variant container the two targets select different
  worlds: `default: CUI` renders the CUI world and obliges its cells, while
  `example: CUI` leaves the discriminant blank. Also removed:
  `quillmark:must_fill` from the transform schema, which is the wire *validity*
  contract, and an unauthored must-fill cell is wire-valid by design; the
  declaration view carries `default:` for a consumer that wants to derive.
  No in-tree quill declared the key and the declaration view emits only what an
  author wrote, so no emitted JSON changes for any real quill — the WASM
  `QuillFieldSchema` TS interface loses `must_fill?: boolean`, a compile-time
  break for editors typed against it.
- fix: **seeding descends into a container's `example:`.** A dictionary with no
  `example:` of its own seeded nothing, so a property's `example:` was
  unreachable at every projection — the render floor never emits an example, and
  the blueprint is a different document. A seed is now composed from whatever
  its cells commit, sparse at every depth, and stays absent when none of them
  commit anything. Markers ride the cell they belong to.
- fix: `resolve()`'s rung is honest for a container. It has no rung of its own,
  so it reports the strongest that contributed: `authored` when the document
  wrote any of it, else `default` when a cell below resolved to one, else the
  floor. An absent container over defaulted cells read `blank` while rendering
  those defaults, which is the fact an editor ghosts from. Nothing inside a
  container the document did not author reads `authored`. A variant container
  counts its live world's cells the same way, so writing one of them lifts a
  container whose discriminant fell to the schema's `default:`.

- chore(deps): the Typst floor moves to 0.15.1. The workspace already resolved
  there under the 0.15.0 caret; the pin now names the version the tree is built
  and tested against. `pdf-writer` stays at 0.15.0, still the version
  `typst-pdf` → `krilla` forces and the newest published.
- docs: `0.107-to-0.108.md`, the guide for this step. It leads with the two load
  errors, since both reject the quill rather than the document, and gives
  `must_fill: true` beside a `default:` — the one behavior deleted — the space
  its judgment call needs. `BLUEPRINT.md` § "Typed dictionaries" loses the `{}`
  expansion and the container-literal renderings with the cascade that produced
  them, and states the nesting the 0.107 collapse admits.

## v0.107.0 - 2026-08-17

- fix(typst): `display(field, ..)` validates its address against the schema, the
  assert `form-field` and `field-region` already carry. It is the one helper keyed
  by address rather than by value, and it was the one accepting an address the
  schema does not have: `display("issed", "[year]")` compiled, drew nothing, and
  reported nothing — the failure a plate author is least placed to see, a card
  address being a string the plate builds by concatenating `$path`. `_qm-display`
  cannot catch it, carrying an entry per *present* date, so a blank date and a
  typo are absent from it alike; `_qm-known-path` answers about the schema and
  tells the two apart. A known address carrying no date still returns `none`, so
  a `== none` fallback is unchanged: the assert is about the address, the `none`
  about the value.
- fix: **a container's own `default:` reaches the plate as content.** The render
  floor read `default_content` only for a `richtext`/`plaintext` leaf. An
  `object` or `array` carrying its `default:` on the container fell through to
  the raw literal instead, crossing as unimported markdown where every other
  content position delivers a canonical content object. The companion was
  already cached and never read. The floor now keys off the cache — present is
  the form to commit, absent over a content-bearing tree blank-fills — which
  covers leaf and container alike and drops the type test. `usaf_memo`'s
  `references` (`array<richtext(inline)>`, `default: []`) carried the same
  defect, invisible only because the list was empty.
- **breaking** a container-shaped `default:`/`example:` on a variant-bearing
  enum is a load error (`quill::default_type_mismatch`,
  `quill::example_type_mismatch`). A quill declaring one loaded before, so the
  upgrade reads as a quill that stopped loading rather than as a fix.
  The container is the shape a *document* writes. As a schema literal it cached
  no content form and yielded no discriminant, so the field blank-filled in
  silence as if nothing were declared. The diagnostic names the discriminant
  spelling instead, which is where a world's cells carry their own literals.
  Scalar literals are unaffected.

- feat: **every type nests at every depth**. A property or an element is an
  ordinary field, so it carries whatever a card-level field carries, itself
  included: `object<array<string>>`, `array<array<integer>>`, a typed table whose
  row holds a typed dictionary, and a variant cell holding either.
  `quill::nested_object_not_supported` and `quill::nested_array_not_supported`
  are gone, and `ShapePosition`'s three positions collapse to the one question
  the walk still asks — is this card level, where `variants:` and `ui.group` are
  the two keys that live. A widening: every quill that loaded before loads
  unchanged.
  The depth budget was what the flat address tables existed for.
  `SchemaMeta` carried six name-keyed tables (`array_fields`, `object_fields`
  and their card twins) so the helper's `_qm-known-path` could enumerate two
  suffix steps rather than derive a grammar; they are replaced by one address
  tree — the schema pruned to the steps it offers — that the helper and the span
  scan both walk, converging on the unbounded descent `pdfform::bind` always
  had. Three components deriving an address become one walk each side of the
  seam, and `quillmark/tests/address_grammar.rs` pins the two against the deep
  shapes as well as the shallow ones.
  `variants:` stays card-level, now on its own reasoning rather than by
  inheriting the depth ban: a variant's shape is a function of the schema *and*
  the discriminant, and the union projection, the once-bound form, the plate's
  single branch and `validation::out_of_variant` each hold because that gap is
  one level deep ([SCHEMAS.md](prose/canon/SCHEMAS.md) §"Enum variants"). An
  array-valued variant cell used to report `nested_array_not_supported`, whose
  message named array elements and object properties — neither the situation;
  the shape is now legal and `quill::variant_placement` is left saying only what
  it means.
- fix: `blueprint()` expands a container at every depth. `build_property_mapping`
  spent each property through the scalar builder, so a nested `object` or typed
  table rendered as `key: null # object` — its own properties, their markers and
  their annotations absent — where the same shape one level up expanded. It now
  recurses, and the card-level and nested paths are one implementation, so a
  `default:` covers its subtree identically wherever it is declared. No
  document changes shape: the shapes this fixes could not be declared before.
- fix: a content leaf's `default:` reaches the plate from **every** position it
  can be declared in, not only card level. The load pass that imports each
  richtext/plaintext literal into its companion cache walked the card's field
  map, so an `object` property, a typed-table row property and a variant cell
  each kept their authored `default:` and cached nothing; the render floor read
  the leaf's empty companion and blank-filled. A document authoring only the
  container (`dict: {}`, `rows: [{}]`, `c: {value: CUI}`) rendered correctly
  with the author's default missing, and nothing upstream had anything to
  report. The walk now recurses `properties` / `items` / `variants`, the shapes
  `field_contains_content` already descended, so such a document now renders
  **with** the author's default — a render-output change for any quill that
  declared one. Importing a literal is also what checks it, so a nested
  `richtext(inline)` violation — in a `default:` or an `example:` — now fails
  load as a card-level one always has, naming the leaf's declaration path.
  **Breaking on that second count**: the literal loaded before, so a quill
  carrying one stops loading. Nested `example:` *surfacing* was never broken:
  the blueprint prints the raw literal at every depth.
- **breaking** typst: a plate's direct read of a typed-table row cell regions on
  the cell (`refs.0.org`), where it regioned on the whole array before — a
  *wrong* address, not a missing one, routing a click on the org cell to the
  entire table. The span scan was the third component deriving a schema address
  and the one left at the one-level ceiling: 0.106 lifted the lowering walk and
  `_qm-known-path` to the row property, so the three no longer agreed, and the
  scan is the one that decides what a *read* is attributed to. It now takes the
  index step (`.at(n)`, the only spelling Typst has for an array index) and then
  the row property, gated on the `array_fields` table. Each step is its own
  address, so a whole-row read names the row (`refs.0`) and a primitive
  element's read names the element (`tags.0`); a negative index and an
  undeclared row key mint nothing and fall back as before. Consumers keying on
  the array's address for element ink see the narrower address instead. Explicit
  `field-region` / `form-field` claims are unchanged, and the alias lane keeps
  parity: `#let row = data.refs.at(0)` … `#row.org` regions on `refs.0.org`.
- test: one table pins the schema address grammar on both backends
  (`quillmark/tests/address_grammar.rs`), covering every position the nesting
  contract admits, each position's card twin, and the rejects that bound each
  step. `PLATE_DATA.md` promises a plate author that one address binds on
  either backend, and the grammar is written twice to keep it — an unbounded
  schema walk in `pdfform::bind`, an enumeration of the suffix forms in the
  Typst helper's `_qm-known-path` — reading two different projections of the
  same `QuillConfig`, so either side can move alone. `pdfform` exports
  `resolves_schema_address` (`#[doc(hidden)]`) so the pin can ask both the same
  question. A body address is the plate grammar's alone and is pinned as such.

- **breaking** typst: lowering dispatches on the schema node beside each value
  rather than on tables of top-level field names, so a declared type means the
  same thing wherever it is declared. A `date`, `richtext` or `plaintext`
  declared inside an `object` or an `array` row reached the plate as its raw
  wire value before — a bare string for a date, and for a rich field the
  *internal canonical-content JSON*, rendered as a Typst dict — while the same
  type one level up lowered correctly. Ten of the twelve nested positions the
  schema admits degraded that way, silently: core coerced and validated the
  value correctly, so nothing upstream had anything to report. `contact.note`
  is now a markup block, `contact.reply_by` and `rows.0.on` are `datetime`s,
  and `_qm-plaintext` gains the nested entries that closed the
  `plaintext(field)` escape hatch. The walk is the inverse of the one
  `build_transform_schema` builds the node with, so it cannot be shallower than
  the schema is.
- **breaking** typst: a `date` / `datetime` field lowers to a **native**
  `datetime`, not the `(value:, display:)` wrapper. `data.issued.year()`,
  `data.issued < data.due` and handing the field to a datetime-consuming
  package are ordinary Typst; `.value` and the paren form `(data.issued.display)(..)`
  are hard Typst compile errors, never a silent degrade, and all consumers are
  first party. A date has no canonical rendering the way authored text does —
  every rendering of `2026-01-02` is a typographic decision the plate owns — so
  it lowers to its value and reaches ink by address instead.
- feat(typst): `display(field, ..args)`, a date field's content projection,
  keyed by schema address rather than carried on the value. It places rendered
  ink whose glyphs are born in generated source, so a date formatted through a
  `#let` binding, a per-card loop variable, or a vendored package keeps a
  region on its schema field — the affordance the value-object existed to buy,
  now available to any date at any depth without shaping the value. `none` for
  a blank date, so a `== none` fallback still fires. The rule plates follow:
  want a value → `data.<field>`; want clickable ink → `display("<field>", ..)`.
- feat: a variant cell may carry **any type a card field may**, prose and dates
  included — `quill::variant_field_type` is gone. The load error existed because
  lowering read flat top-level name tables that could not descend into a
  container, so a `date` or `richtext` cell inside a variant would have loaded
  clean and reached the plate as its raw wire value; the schema-node walk reads
  the cell's own declaration, leaving the ceiling nothing to protect. Every value
  surface already descended per live-world cell — coercion through
  `conform_value`, validation through `validate_value`, the render floor through
  `resolve_value` — so the widening needed one real fix:
  `field_contains_content` returned `false` for a variant container on the
  strength of this very guard, which would have silently skipped the content
  companion caches, the resting-form conversion and the seed path for a variant
  content cell. It now answers on the union of the worlds' cells. Containers
  are included: "every type nests at every depth" lands in this same release, so
  a variant cell holds a typed table or a typed dictionary like any other
  position. `variants:` itself stays card-level (`quill::variant_placement`) on
  the reasoning stated there.

- **breaking** typst: the `plaintext(field)` helper and its `_qm-plaintext`
  table are removed. Shipped in 0.94 as the sanctioned content→`str` coercion,
  it never acquired a caller: no plate, no vendored package, and no binding
  surface referenced it, and the `create-auto-grid` consumer its own docstring
  cited passes an `array<string>` rather than a content field, so the only
  things exercising it were its three tests. It also carried a three-way name
  collision with the `plaintext` field type and that type's document-layer
  resting shape, which took a standing caveat in canon and the template to hold
  down. A plate that needs a `str` from a content field now has no route, which
  is the honest state of the requirement: reinstating it is additive and cheap
  when a plate actually asks.
- feat(typst): a typed table's row property (`refs.0.org`) is a writable
  schema address. `form-field(field:)` and `field-region` capped at one suffix
  step while pdfform's resolver descended unboundedly, so a shape
  `ShapePosition` explicitly admits bound on one backend only, against
  `PLATE_DATA.md`'s claim that one address binds on either. `array_fields` now
  carries each array's row property names, the same shape `object_fields`
  already had.
- fix(typst): a non-blank date the shared parsers reject raises
  `backend::invalid_date` from codegen rather than a pre-pass over top-level
  name tables, so the check covers every depth. Only a direct `apply` can
  deliver one; coercion parses the same way.
- feat(typst): a scalar read through a `let` alias regions on the address the
  chain it names would carry, so `#let c = data.classification` … `#c.poc`
  surfaces `classification.poc` where it surfaced nothing at all — not the
  container's address, absent. Binding a container once and stepping into it
  three times is the refactor 0.106's property addressing invites, and it cost
  the address silently, the document still rendering correctly. An alias holds
  only where the plate binds the name exactly once to one whole `data` chain: a
  name a second `let`, a closure parameter, a loop pattern, an import, or an
  assignment could rebind is dropped rather than risk attributing another
  value's ink to the field, and a wildcard import disqualifies every alias.
  Which name is followed is half the rule; which *occurrence* is the other half,
  since a schema field name collides freely with the parameter names of a callee
  the plate never defines (`date`, `title`, `caption`, `align`, `subject`). Only
  an occurrence that reads the binding anchors: an identifier spelling the alias
  as a named argument (`#text(size: 12pt)`), a dict key, another value's field
  (`#styles.subject`) or an imported item's path draws no ink off the field, and
  a window minted over one would carry a *wrong* address rather than a missing
  one.
  Laundering past that — a function parameter, a destructured binding, a
  per-card loop variable — is unchanged and still needs a `field-region` claim,
  now stated for plate authors under "Which Reads Get Regions" in the Typst
  backend guide. Content and date fields are unaffected: their ink is born in
  generated code.

- feat(wasm): `VARIANT_DISCRIMINANT_KEY` joins the runtime's static exports,
  beside `MAIN_CARD_ADDR`. v0.106.0 announced the constant as new API but shipped
  it to Rust only, leaving a JS consumer reading or writing a variant container
  to spell `"value"` itself — a hardcoded copy of the one value whose purpose is
  to not be hardcoded, at the seam where the two can drift unobserved, since the
  key crosses the boundary inside untyped container data. The `.d.ts` types it as
  the string *literal*, which `string` would stop narrowing an index into the
  container. `known_names_drift.rs` pins both spellings against the Rust
  constant, the guard the hand-spelled name tables beside it already carry.
  `VariantFields` stays Rust-only: it is a type alias the TypeScript surface
  already inlines as `QuillFieldSchema.variants`, naming no shape a consumer
  builds.
- docs: `0.105-to-0.106.md`, the migration guide v0.106.0 shipped without. It
  leads with the region-address shift rather than the three `!` entries: the
  changelog is organized by feature, and the address step is one clause inside a
  long entry while being the item most likely to break a working consumer, since
  `FieldRegion.field` is a bare `string` that no type checker reports a grammar
  change under. The guide states both gates on the step, and points a consumer at
  `doc.pathFor` for the prefix grammar it would otherwise match as a literal —
  with that helper's limit stated, a field name passing through it verbatim.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains the two rules that would have caught the gap: `!` marks
  an observable-contract shift even where no type changes, and a release carrying
  one ships its guide.
- docs: `0.106-to-0.107.md`, this release's guide, under the rule the entry above
  adds. It leads with the region-address index step — `main.refs[0].org` where
  `main.refs` stood, a wrong address rather than a missing one — and then with
  the two schema literals that stop a quill loading, since those read as a build
  that broke rather than as a fix. `ERROR.md` names `display(..)` as the
  address-keyed template-author contract, `plaintext(..)` having been removed
  here.

## v0.106.0 - 2026-08-16

- feat(typst,pdfform): a schema address may step one property into a declared
  container, so `form-field(field: "classification.poc")` and
  `field-region("address.city")` name a cell rather than the container holding
  it. Two generated address tables gate the step the way `array_fields` gates
  the index step, and a typed dictionary and a variant container reach both
  alike: `classification.value` addresses the discriminant, `classification.poc`
  a variant cell in any world. The pdfform binder descends a variant container
  to match, so one address binds on either backend where `address.city` bound
  only on pdfform and asserted on Typst. **Region addresses shift** for a plate
  that reads a container property directly: `#data.classification.poc` regions
  as `classification.poc` where it regioned as `classification`, and `fieldAt`
  answers the same. A container read whole is unchanged, as is a read of a key
  the container does not declare.
- feat(core,wasm)!: an `enum` may declare `variants:`, a per-member field set
  that exists only in the world where the discriminant holds that member. This
  is the DSL's first cross-field shape, and it replaces the `cui_`-prefix
  convention with one the engine checks: `must_fill` inside a variant keeps its
  ordinary `default:`-presence derivation, so it reads *required in this world* —
  a `poc` obliged on a CUI memo and silent on every other one, the thing
  `must_fill` alone could not say. **Breaking**: declaring `variants:` changes
  the field's resting shape at every projection, from a bare string to a
  container, `{value: <member>, …that member's fields}`; the bare scalar
  (`classification: CUI`) is still accepted as the spelling of a world carrying
  no answers, and coercion normalizes both. The wire carries exactly the live
  world, so a plate reads a variant field inside the `values ∪ blank` branch it
  already owes the enum, and inside that branch every declared field is present
  and needs no guard. A value stranded by a discriminant flip is kept and warned
  (`validation::out_of_variant`), never dropped at coercion or gated at render.
  The ceiling is enforced at load, not discovered at render: a variant carries
  plain data only, sits at card level only, and cannot declare `value`. The
  transform schema projects the container with every world's fields flattened
  under `properties`, since a binding built once against a schema must address a
  field today's document has not selected; member scoping stays on the
  declaration view, where `schema()` emits `variants:` keyed by member.
  `FieldSchema` gains `variants` and `variant_field` (the cell a name declares
  under any world); `VariantFields` and `VARIANT_DISCRIMINANT_KEY` are new.
- feat(fixtures)!: `usaf_memo`'s four `cui_*` fields move under
  `classification`'s `CUI` variant as `controlled_by`, `poc`, `category`, and
  `limited_dissemination`. `controlled_by` and `poc` drop their `default: ""`
  and are therefore obliged — on a CUI memo only, which is what DoDM 5200.48
  actually requires and what the flat spelling could state only in
  `description:` prose. A document writes `classification: {value: CUI, …}` and
  a plate reads `data.classification.value`.
- feat(typst): `field-region(field, body)` claims the ink `body` draws for a
  schema field, so a plate can tie content it *composes* — a banner keyed on a
  field, a package-built block, a computed table — to `session.regions()` and
  `session.fieldAt(..)`. Layout-neutral: `body` is returned untouched between two
  invisible `metadata` markers. It is a **fallback** claim, never an override:
  ink already tracked to a field keeps that field, so wrapping is purely
  additive and cannot retarget. Each *call* claims independently, so a wrapper
  invoked once per card yields one region per card — the way a card's scalar
  fields get regions at all, reading as they do from a loop variable that carries
  no per-instance identity. The marker stack persists across pages so a claim can
  span a page break, which leaves a claim whose closing marker never reaches a
  frame bounded by nothing: it would take every unattributed piece of ink to the
  end of the document. Those are found before the scan and suppressed in both the
  region and point queries — an unbounded claim yields nothing rather than
  everything — and reported as a `typst::unclosed_field_region` warning naming
  the field, since only the plate author can act on it. Typst does not separate
  the two markers on its own — they are siblings in content flow — but a plate
  emitting the call's return value in parts can.
- feat(typst,pdf): `form-field` takes `font`, `size`, and `align`, so an
  injected widget's value can be set to match the type around it. A widget was
  fixed at Helvetica, auto-size, left: auto-size makes the rendered size a
  function of both box height and how much the user has typed, and left
  justification cannot be overcome by geometry, because a fillable box is sized
  for the longest plausible value rather than the value in it. A right-aligned
  fill-in — a USAF memo's date, say — was unreachable. `font` is one of
  `"helvetica"`/`"times"`/`"courier"`, a widget being unable to carry a font
  program; `size` is an absolute length or `auto` for the old behavior; `align`
  is `"left"`/`"center"`/`"right"` and lands in `/Q`. All three are rejected on
  `"checkbox"` and `"signature"`, which carry no variable text. `FieldSpec`
  gains `font`, `font_size`, and `align` (`FormFont` and `TextAlign` are new).
  A field that sets none of them stamps byte-identically to before, and
  `pdfform` is untouched: `form.json` still carries no styling, so the flatten
  path and canvas preview are unchanged.
- fix(fixtures): the `usaf_memo` indorsement date widget is set in the memo's
  own 12pt Times and ends on the right margin, where the date it stands in for
  would have ended. It was auto-sized Helvetica starting at the fill-in rule's
  left end. Sizing it exposed that the rule-width box clips a real date — "28
  September 2026" sets 93pt at 12pt Times against a 72pt box, and a fixed size
  clips where auto-size had silently shrunk — so the widget is now 10em wide
  and hangs off the rule's right edge, overrunning leftwards into the
  whitespace a printed date grows into. Sized in ems of its own face rather
  than inches because `font_size` is a document field with no ceiling: an inch
  width would stay put while the text inside it grew. 10em clears both
  orderings at any body size (DAF's "September 28, 2026" is the widest at
  8.03em; USAF's "28 September 2026" is 7.78em). `date-placeholder-line` seats
  it with a measured `dx` rather than `place(bottom + right)`, Typst clamping
  an overflowing alignment back to zero, which leaves `right` indistinguishable
  from `left`. That helper draws no rule now and is named `date-placeholder`
  rather than `date-placeholder-line`: the widget carries the date, and a rule
  under a widget wider than it underlines only the fraction of the value narrow
  enough to sit over it. It is package-internal, not exported from `lib.typ`.
- fix(core): a name two variants declare *differently* is a load error,
  `quill::variant_field_collision`. The name is one cell of the container
  whichever world brings it into play — neither the coercion lookup nor the
  transform schema consults the discriminant to fill it — so two readings of it
  coerced a live value under the other world's type: a document selecting a
  world whose `note` is `integer` had its `42` coerced to `"42"` by a sibling
  world's `string` and then failed `validation::type_mismatch`, undraftable and
  blamed for a string it never wrote. Identical declarations, which is what
  repeating a shared field set or sharing a YAML anchor produces, collapse to
  that one cell without loss and stay legal.
- fix(core,wasm,python)!: `EditError::UnknownField` carries the in-field path
  `FieldDecode` and `FieldNotContent` carry. A property an `object` field does
  not declare — `get_content_at("address", [Key("zip")])` against an `address`
  with no `zip` — reported `field 'zip' is not declared in the schema`, which
  reads as a claim about a top-level field and collides outright when a real
  top-level field shares the name. It now reports
  `field 'address.zip' is not declared in the schema` and anchors the
  diagnostic at `main.address.zip`, so the caller can tell an undeclared
  property from an undeclared field. **Breaking**: the variant is a struct
  variant, `UnknownField { field, at }`, matching the two siblings; `field`
  stays a bare field name, and the `edit::unknown_field` code, its `field` arg
  and the whole-field message are unchanged.
- fix(python): declaring `license-files` ships the `LICENSE` the sdist metadata
  names, which PyPI rejected the sdist for lacking. v0.104.0 and v0.105.0 are
  wheels only.

## v0.105.0 - 2026-08-14

- feat(core,wasm,python)!: a `Content` nested inside a composite field is
  readable at its own codec. `TypedReader::get_content_at(name, path)` (and the
  `CardReader` twin, `reader.getContentAt(addr, path)` in JS,
  `reader.get_content_at(name, path)` in Python) walks a `PathSegment` path
  through the field schema — `items` for an index, `properties` for a key — to
  the leaf whose declared type names the codec, then decodes through the same
  dispatch the whole-field read uses. So an `array<richtext>` element, an
  `object`'s content property and a leaf under both each read back the same
  `Content` whatever their resting form, where before every one of them
  answered `FieldNotContent` and the consumer had to decide for itself what the
  stored bytes meant (#1243). The empty path *is* `get_content`. A path naming
  nothing in the stored value reads absent rather than throwing: an editor's
  row index goes stale between derive and read, and that is the axis a repeater
  mutates. `Addr` deliberately gains no element axis — the path is the read's
  own argument, since `storeField` / `isFill` / `applyChange` could not answer
  one. **Breaking**: `EditError::FieldDecode` and `EditError::FieldNotContent`
  each gain an `at: Vec<PathSegment>` field carrying the in-field path, so the
  diagnostic anchors at `main.paragraphs[1]` and parses back to those segments;
  `field` stays a bare field name and `args` is unchanged. `FieldNotContent`
  now names the type *reached*, so a `string[]` element reports `string` rather
  than the field's `array`.
- feat(core,wasm)!: `must_fill:` on a field declares the **obligation** axis.
  `default:` carried the fill value and the obligation signal on one bit, so
  only that 2x2's diagonal was reachable; a safe value that still wants a
  human's confirmation (`default: UNCLASSIFIED` with `must_fill: true`) and a
  genuinely optional field with nothing to suggest (`must_fill: false`) now
  each have a spelling. Left unset it derives `default.is_none()`, so no
  existing quill's blueprint marker set changes. `Quill::validate` gains a
  second trigger under the one `validation::must_fill` code, named by a
  `trigger` arg: `marker` for a `!must_fill` tag the document carries, and
  `unauthored` where the schema obliges a cell the document leaves absent or
  present-null. The second closes a hole — `validate_fills` walked only the
  payload, so a hand-written or programmatically built document drew no
  completeness signal whatever `Quill.yaml` declared. **Breaking**: a merely
  incomplete document no longer validates clean. Absence is still never
  *malformed* and still never gates render, but a consumer reading "any
  diagnostic ⇒ not done" now sees a warning per unauthored obliged cell on
  documents that were silent. The obligation keys on cell presence rather than
  the resolved source rung, so a must-fill leaf inside a container someone
  touched still warns; a typed dict is never itself a cell and recurses to its
  leaves, while an array is one cell, `[]` being a real answer. Authoring the
  field's blank discharges it and `field: null` does not: null ≡ absent stays
  unqualified on the value ladder, but obligation asks whether a human made a
  call. Seeding stamps the marker on example-seeded obliged cells, so a fresh
  seed and an empty document report the same cells, and the transform schema
  carries `quillmark:must_fill` (#1255).
- fix(core,wasm,pdfform)!: a field's **blank** — its spelling of "explicitly
  nothing" — is a property of the field rather than a member of its type's
  domain, and an `enum`'s is `""`. The render floor for a defaultless enum
  returned `values.first()`: a choice nobody made, indistinguishable at the
  plate from a deliberate one and reachable from a cosmetic `values:` reorder.
  An unanswered enum now renders `""`, so a reorder is render-safe for every
  document and only removing or renaming a member breaks
  ([VERSIONING.md](prose/canon/VERSIONING.md)). **The accepted domain widens to
  `values ∪ blank` for *every* enum**, defaulted ones included: `format: ""`
  was a fatal `EnumViolation` and now coerces, validates and reaches the plate.
  **A plate must therefore branch exhaustively over `values ∪ blank`** — an
  `else` fallback re-opens exactly the fabrication the blank closes, and a
  downstream package that asserts membership fails the compile outright. Note
  `data.at(key, default: X)` is not a guard here: blank-filled render makes
  every declared key present, so its `default:` is dead code and the blank
  flows through. **Breaking**: `zero_value` → `blank`, `FieldSource::Zero` →
  `Blank` and its wire token `"zero"` → `"blank"`; `""` declared in `values:`
  is a load error (`quill::enum_blank_member`), the engine supplying the blank
  instead; and `date: ""` renders blank rather than falling back to a
  `default:`, settling a three-way disagreement between coercion, validation
  and the floor. `default: ""` stays valid and keeps its meaning — `values:`
  enumerates choices, `default:` is a value, and the blank is a legal value
  that is never a choice. Additive: `ui.blank_title` labels an enum's blank and
  rides the transform schema as `quillmark:blank_title`; that schema's `enum:`
  leads with the blank, so a standard JSON-Schema validator accepts what the
  engine accepts, and pdfform Choice widgets lead their options with it too. A
  consumer's picker must keep the blank selectable and re-selectable — returning
  to it is how an author clears a cell back to unset.
  `integer`, `number` and `boolean` keep `0` / `false` as their blank,
  indistinguishable from an authored zero — a permanent seam, since a wire
  `none` would cost the totality the floor exists to buy. Full guide:
  [0.104 → 0.105](docs/migrations/0.104-to-0.105.md) (#1254).
- fix(fixtures,docs): the three fixture plates that dispatch on `$kind` read it
  with a bare `card.at("$kind")`, which panics on a kindless card, and guarded
  declared fields against an absence blank-filled render makes impossible.
  Plate authors copy the fixtures rather than `PLATE_DATA.md`, so the fixtures
  were teaching both the unsafe metadata read and a dead presence check.
  `classic_resume` carried the live consequence: `url` is declared with no
  `default:`, so the floor delivers `""`, `default: none` never fires, and the
  package's `url != none` test always passes — an empty Courier element where
  the block should have been skipped. Its `subheading-*` guard cost an empty
  grid row the same way. Declared fields now guard their *value*, and
  `docs/quills/typst-backend.md` states the rule as a table over the three key
  kinds. `fixture_quills_render_test` renders every fixture quill's seed
  document — the net that was missing, since `classic_resume`'s plate had no
  test reaching it (#1256, #1257).
- test(typst): `plaintext` reaches regions and navigation by inheritance — the
  render floor coerces its resting literal to a content object, the backend
  classifies that object by `contentMediaType` alone, and the shared lowering
  emits it with a segment map — and every step was load-bearing and untested,
  with the classification predicates named for richtext so the sharing read as
  a coincidence. Pinned at engine altitude, because a test driving the backend
  directly hand-builds the content object, bypassing the floor's coercion, and
  would stay green through a regression that silently empties `regions()`. The
  predicates are `is_content_field` / `is_content_array_field` /
  `is_inline_content_field`, and `PREVIEW.md` names plaintext beside richtext
  in its producer list (#1247, #1250).

## v0.104.0 - 2026-08-13

- feat(core,wasm): a quill declares, per body, the block constructs its plate
  does not typeset (`main.body.unsupported`, `card_kinds.<k>.body.unsupported`;
  names from `heading`, `rule`, `code`, `list`, `quote`, `table`, `image`).
  A body holding one anyway draws the non-fatal `plate::unsupported_construct`,
  a fifth warning family, on the pre-render walk `Quill::parse` runs beside
  `conform`: one diagnostic per (body, construct) carrying the count in `args`
  and the body's path, so occurrences collapse rather than scatter. The
  declaration also rides `QuillConfig::schema()` to the editor, which is the
  half a render-time warning could not serve: it answers before the gesture.
  Nothing verifies a declaration — a plate that drops an undeclared construct
  stays as silent as before. `usaf_memo` declares `rule`; empty everywhere
  else, so no existing quill's schema or warnings change.
- fix(fixtures): `usaf_memo`'s `render-body` drained its heading buffer in the
  three shapes that used to discard it. A heading with nothing after it (the
  buffer died with the loop, taking a list item's bullet with it), a heading
  whose next element opened a *different* list item (its text was delivered
  into that item), and a heading following a heading (the assignment overwrote
  the earlier one) each lost their text with nothing in the render to say so.
  The run-in style is unchanged where it was right: a heading joins the next
  block of its own item, or the next paragraph at top level.
- fix(content)!: `to_markdown` writes `***` for a thematic break, not `---`.
  `- ` + `---` is four dashes separated by spaces, which re-imports as a
  top-level break, so a rule as a bullet item's first block lost its item on
  every markdown round-trip. The canonical spelling is now the one with the
  fewest other readings (`---` is also a setext underline and the root-block
  front-matter opener). Exported markdown changes for documents holding a
  rule; the content model, wire data and rendered output do not.
- refactor(core,pdfform,cli,wasm)!: the `enum:` modifier on `type: string`
  retires. `type: enum` with a `values:` list is the one spelling of a finite
  string domain; `enum:` on any type is now `quill::field_parse_error`, whose
  message names the replacement — it is the only diagnostic a quill written
  against the modifier ever received, since the deprecation shipped in 0.94
  with no warning code behind it. `QuillConfig::schema()` re-emits every
  domain as `values:`, so a consumer reading `enum:` off the schema echo (the
  wasm `QuillFieldSchema.enum`, dropped here) reads `values:` instead. The
  `usaf_memo` and `sample_form` fixtures migrate; wire data and rendered
  output are unchanged, the projections being domain-keyed already.
- fix(core): `build_transform_schema` keys a field's finite domain on the
  domain itself rather than the `Enum` token, joining the render floor, the
  pdfform widget kind and the blueprint annotation. Under the retired
  spelling every `usaf_memo` enum — `classification`, `format`, `action` —
  projected as a bare `{"type":"string"}`, so a consumer building a
  JSON-Schema validator from the transform schema accepted
  `classification: "banana"` while pdfform drew the six-option dropdown for
  the same field and `QuillConfig` rejected the value at coercion (#1237)
- fix(core)!: geometry addresses parse segment-wise, so `locate` and
  `fieldBoxes` answer for an address deeper than one segment. The translation
  boundary folded a plate address's whole tail into one `Field`, so
  `references.0` minted `main.references.0` — a string that reparses as a field
  literally named `0`, and that the reverse direction refused outright. Both
  spellings returned `None`, leaving caret placement and whole-field highlight
  dead for **every** `array<richtext>` element (the flagship memo's
  `references` among them) and for every nested key a pdfform widget binds
  (`address.city`). `region.rs` now reads and renders a plate tail one segment
  at a time: an all-digit segment is an array index, `$body` the body terminal,
  anything else a field or map key.
- change(wasm, python)!: `RenderedRegion.field`, `FieldRegion.field` and
  `ContentHit.field` spell an array element bracketed — `main.references.0`
  becomes `main.references[0]` — on `regions()`, `fieldAt`, `positionAt` and
  `RenderResult.regions`. This is the spelling schema validation already emits,
  so a `Diagnostic.path` and the geometry address for one place are now the same
  string. A consumer finding an address's children by prefix (`startsWith(`${field}.`)`)
  needs the `[` opener too, and any heuristic reading a trailing all-digit field
  name as a lost index is dead.
- feat(wasm): `doc.pathFor(addr)` mints an `Addr` as the canonical `DocPath`
  string `Diagnostic.path` carries and `session.locate` / `session.fieldBoxes`
  take; `doc.cardPath(i)` is the card's own root. `Document` computed the
  kind-qualified root for every addressed write and did not hand it out, so a
  consumer building a path restated the kind lookup, the `Addr` defaults and the
  range guard — and a wrong-kind path is compared as a string, matching nothing
  and drawing no highlight without throwing. Both are quill-free (the stored
  `$kind` verbatim) and total on the index axis: a path is an anchor, not a
  read, so a per-keystroke call needs no `try` (#1225)
- change(wasm)!: `@quillmark/wasm` declares `engines: { node: ">=24" }`, the
  tier CI builds and tests the bindings on and the one both devcontainers hand a
  contributor. Nothing in the package requires it at runtime, so a Node 22
  install fails `engines` checking without failing at import.
- docs: `docs/migrations/0.103-to-0.104.md` carries the four breaks — the
  retired `enum:` modifier, the bracketed index spelling, the `***` thematic
  break and the Node floor — with the prefix-match, trailing-digit and stored
  -markdown shapes a consumer has to fix, and the two additive surfaces
  (`pathFor` / `cardPath`, and the `plate::unsupported_construct` family a
  code-routing consumer gains an arm for).
- test(core): three characterization tests pin the render floor's two
  type-domain edges (a defaultless enum, top-level and nested in a typed
  dictionary) and an authored empty `date` beside an empty `string`, so the
  coercion difference between the two is one test's diff. Every shipped quill
  declares a `default:` on every enum and none authors an empty `date`, so the
  fixture suite reached neither path. A fourth carries a `!must_fill` tag on two
  example-seeded cells through seed → store → load → conform. Refs #1234

## v0.103.0 - 2026-08-09

- docs: `docs/integration/operations.md`, carrying what the other integration
  pages leave unsaid: that **render is not bounded** — no deadline, no
  cancellation, and the parse limits do not carry through — with the
  worker-termination recipe that is the only abort a browser has; that
  `Quillmark`, `Quill` and `Document` are `Send + Sync`, pinned by a test rather
  than asserted; `comemo` eviction as what a long-lived process's memory tracks;
  the no-network, no-ambient-filesystem isolation properties; and that a panic
  is terminal on every surface.
- docs: `parse::input_too_large` carries four of the five §8 caps, separable
  only by its `max` arg, which `error-handling.md` now says where it names the
  code.
- test(cli): `quillmark-cli` gets its first tests. The bin carries
  `test = false`, so twelve cases drive the built executable instead — every
  subcommand, `-o` and `--stdout`, PDF and SVG output, and the error paths,
  which must exit 1 rather than panic. The crate had no `[dev-dependencies]`
  and no workflow invoked it (#1068).
- fix(cli)!: `render --verbose` writes its progress lines to stderr, as the
  warning printer already did. Under `--stdout` they went to stdout ahead of and
  after the artifact, so `quillmark render q --stdout --verbose > out.pdf`
  produced a PDF with `Loading quill from: …` before its header and
  `Rendering completed successfully` past its trailer. A script that parses
  `--verbose` output from stdout reads it from stderr now.
- test(fuzz): `pdf_fuzz` covers the AcroForm stamp spine's byte-level reads,
  the one hand-rolled parser with no fuzz target. Arbitrary bytes, and a real
  form truncated, single-byte-corrupted, or spliced, all through
  `page_media_boxes` / `PdfUpdate::begin` / `stamp`. The oracle is no panic:
  nothing in the workspace catches unwind, so a panic there kills the CLI and
  the Python extension and poisons the WASM module. No failures found.
- fix(core): `MAX_FIELD_COUNT`'s rustdoc said "per document"; the check is per
  card-yaml block, counted after `$`-key extraction.
- refactor(wasm)!: `init()` resolves to the core surface, and it is the only way
  to reach one. `Quill`, `Document`, `importMarkdown`, `exportMarkdown`,
  `rebase`, `mapPos`, `parseDocPath` and `formatDocPath` leave the static
  exports of `@quillmark/wasm`: `const { Quill, Document } = await init()`
  replaces the value import. The precondition was carried entirely by
  `init`'s signature, and a floating promise is an ESLint rule rather than a
  `tsc` diagnostic, so a call site that skipped the await type-checked and then
  passed or failed by load order. It now has no name to call. `Engine`,
  `MAIN_CARD_ADDR`, `isQuillmarkError`, the open-set guards and the
  writer/reader classes are unchanged, needing no instance or gated by their
  arguments; the `Quill` / `Document` **type** exports are unchanged, so
  annotations and `import type` compile as before. Class identity is untouched:
  the gate hands out the core build's classes verbatim, and `instanceof` stays
  the whole membership test. `runtime::not_initialized` and the build-time
  sentinel that raised it retire with the door they guarded. Rust, Python,
  documents and stored blobs are unaffected. See
  `docs/migrations/0.102-to-0.103.md`

## v0.102.0 - 2026-08-04

The pre-1.0 vocabulary reset. Verbs, diagnostic codes, and two words that meant
different things at different altitudes. Documents and stored blobs are
untouched: no document reparses, no blob remigrates, and the storage wire format
is byte-identical, but nearly every consumer touches at least one renamed verb.
The diagnostic codes are the part that could not wait, since consumers route on
them and 1.0 freezes them. All breaking changes are covered by
`docs/migrations/0.101-to-0.102.md`. Only two behaviors change, both called out
below. Separately, `@quillmark/wasm` ships `--target web`, which makes
`await init()` mandatory and the bundler plugins the package used to demand
unnecessary.

- refactor(core,wasm,python)!: the verb vocabulary is reset to say what the code
  does. `install_body` / `install_field` / `doc.install` become `overwrite_*` /
  `doc.overwrite`: the content lane is a ladder sorted by the fate of the
  identity anchors already on the value (overwrite destroys, revise rebases,
  apply preserves), and only the first keeps nothing, which grouping the three as
  "identity-aware" hid. `LiveSession::apply` becomes `update`, taking the trait
  seam, the feature-gated raw-plate seam, and `backend::apply_unsupported` →
  `backend::update_unsupported` with it, so the content lane's `applyChange`
  splice is no longer a homograph of a whole-document recompile.
  `apply_field_richtext_change` becomes `apply_field_change`, matching its
  schema-blind neighbour `revise_field`, which never carried the codec in its
  name. `store_seed_namespace` / `remove_seed_namespace` become
  `store_seed_overlay` / `remove_seed_overlay`, closing the asymmetry with the
  `seedOverlay` read and the `SeedOverlay` type that already shipped: `$seed` is
  keyed by a validated card-kind, `$ext` by a free-form consumer namespace.
  `getMarkdown` and reader `get_body` become `bodyMarkdown` / `body_markdown`,
  the name core already used, so one projection has one name on every surface
  (#1186). See `docs/migrations/0.101-to-0.102.md`
- refactor(core,wasm,python)!: the mutator and validation diagnostic codes are
  corrected, and the content-field failures carry the codec that ran.
  `edit::field_richtext_decode` becomes `edit::field_decode` and
  `edit::field_richtext_not_inline` becomes `edit::field_not_inline`, each
  gaining a `codec` arg (`"richtext"` or `"plaintext"`): both were raised for
  plaintext failures under a richtext name, and `plaintext(inline)` fell through
  to the generic code. `edit::field_conform` becomes
  `edit::field_coercion_failed`, killing the `conform::field_conform` stutter and
  landing the variant beside its real twin `validation::coercion_failed`, minted
  from the same `CoercionError`. `richtext::not_inline` and
  `plaintext::not_plain` become `validation::not_inline` / `validation::not_plain`,
  stage-namespaced like every other code. The `conform::*` twins rename in
  lockstep. Route on the code and read `codec` for the lane (#1186). See
  `docs/migrations/0.101-to-0.102.md`
- fix(core)!: a splice against an absent field is no longer a decode error. The
  writer `set_body` / `setBody` becomes `revise_body` / `reviseBody` and returns
  the text `Delta` it was already computing (a body carries no field schema, so a
  typed-lane verb had nothing to type); Python discards the receipt, as on
  `revise_field`. `apply_field_change` on an absent field splices against the
  empty content, as `revise_field` diffs against it, instead of reporting
  `FieldRichtextDecode { message: "field is absent" }`: the one place in the API
  where a missing field was not simply `None`. No error is lost. A bundle that
  expected content still fails, and now reports the condition it hit, since the
  text delta declares the base length it was computed against, so a stale splice
  lands as `edit::content_apply`. Route a vanished-field check on that code, or
  check presence before splicing. These are the release's only behavior changes
  (#1186). See `docs/migrations/0.101-to-0.102.md`
- refactor(core)!: `EditError::variant_name` is removed and the typed primitives
  leave the documented surface. The bare variant name was a second discriminator
  kept in lockstep with `code()` that nothing routed on: both binding error
  mappers stamp `code()` onto the `Diagnostic` they raise, and `ERROR.md` has
  said identity is the code since the `edit::*` family landed. Assert on `code()`
  or match the enum, which is `#[non_exhaustive]` either way. `Card::commit_field`
  and `Card::revise_field_checked` become `#[doc(hidden)]`: a resolved
  `FieldSchema` argument was the only thing telling them from their opaque and
  schema-blind neighbours, and disambiguating by argument is a third mechanism
  beside the receiver and the verb. `quill.writer(&mut doc)` is the typed door on
  every surface now, core included; the primitives stay callable on the same
  terms as the other hidden items (#1186). See `docs/migrations/0.101-to-0.102.md`
- docs(content,core)!: restoring a deleted island re-lands its original id, and
  the island channel states two contracts it had left to the implementation. The
  never-ambient minting rule (continue the field's positional `isl-{n}` sequence,
  never a UUID or a clock reading) covers a *new* island; a delete frees its id
  and the id travels back with the island, so an editor that mints fresh on undo
  renames it, moving the content hash of a document the user believes they
  restored. A pasted copy of a live island is new and mints fresh. Alongside it:
  an island op's `at` is *sequenced*, counting the text the delta and this
  bundle's earlier island ops left rather than the shared post-delta frame; and a
  producer's whole-field diff that carries an island slot must split into the
  slot-free `delta` plus one `Insert` per slot, since a slot in an insert string
  orphans. Neither is a behavior change, and a producer that guessed wrong got a
  wrong document rather than an error (#1185)
- feat(wasm)!: the package ships `--target web` and the runtime owns
  instantiation, so `await init()` once at startup is required before any export
  is used. `--target bundler` emitted `import * as wasm from "./wasm_bg.wasm"`,
  which no browser and no bundler resolves natively; the plugin that fixed it
  rewrote the import into a top-level await, and because the runtime statically
  re-exports core, that await landed on the static module graph of everything
  importing `@quillmark/wasm`: a permanent constraint on consumer architecture
  and a blank SvelteKit route in Safari's dev server that neither Chrome nor
  `vite build` showed. In exchange, `vite-plugin-wasm` and
  `vite-plugin-top-level-await` are no longer needed, a static import is safe
  anywhere including SSR, and plain Node can import the package at all (the ESM
  `.wasm` import needed `--experimental-wasm-modules`). Only
  `optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@quillmark/wasm'] }` stays, for Vite's dev server.
  `init` memoizes its promise, so several entry points share one instantiation
  and a failed attempt clears the memo for a retry; backends are not the
  consumer's to initialize, since `Engine` instantiates one inside its lazy load.
  Reaching the surface early throws `runtime::not_initialized` naming the fix,
  and `build-wasm.sh` asserts both the guard's anchors and that no artifact
  carries a `.wasm` import or a top-level await. `initSync` is not exported: the
  capability remains through `init(source)`, which takes bytes, a `Response`, a
  `WebAssembly.Module`, or a URL (#1189). See `docs/migrations/0.101-to-0.102.md`

## v0.100.0 - 2026-08-03

A content field gets one resting form, and the last reserved `$` key with no
reader is removed. All breaking changes are covered by
`docs/migrations/0.99-to-0.100.md`. Stored documents load unchanged, but a row
read through the bound door converges once: read-repair, not a schema-version
event. One ordering matters, and the guide's "Legacy data" section states it —
conform a stored population before exporting markdown from it.

- refactor(core,wasm,python)!: content fields have one resting form, enforced at
  load. `Quill::conform(&mut doc)` is the primitive and `Quill::parse(md)`
  (parse, then conform) the convenience — the documented primary ingestion path,
  `quill.parse` / `quill.conform` on both bindings. A `richtext` field rests as
  the canonical content object, a `plaintext` field as its **literal string**, so
  the stored shape is a property of the codec instead of the construction lane:
  `equals` and content hashes stop separating semantically identical documents.
  The typed writer commits `plaintext` as a string, and `revise_field` diffs it
  through the literal codec (a byte-identical revise of `a \*b\*` used to commit
  `a *b*`). `Document::parse` / `Document.fromMarkdown` stay exactly as they
  were, demoted to the transport/repair door. Conform is idempotent, a byte no-op
  on an already-canonical document, and reports a `conform::*` warning where the
  strict write refuses rather than retyping or rejecting; a `$quill` naming
  another quill errors before any mutation (#1160, #1162). See
  `docs/migrations/0.99-to-0.100.md`
- fix(core)!: markdown exported from a `plaintext` field resting as a content
  object is markdown-escaped. Emit is schema-free and cannot tell a `plaintext`
  content from a `richtext` one, so `a *literal* line` leaves as
  `a \*literal\* line` and re-parses with the backslashes as characters — one
  more layer per save cycle. Only the typed writer produced that rest, and the
  string rest above deletes it rather than managing it: load, conform, and
  re-store a population before exporting markdown from it. Markdown already
  exported under ≤0.99 is corrupt at rest, its escapes indistinguishable from
  authored ones, so re-export it from the conformed rows (#1159). See
  `docs/migrations/0.99-to-0.100.md`
- fix(core,wasm,python)!: a `plaintext` field resting as a string reads through
  the **literal** codec, not markdown — `note: 'a *literal* line'` read back as
  `a literal line` while render and validation kept the asterisks. Only the
  string lane was wrong; the committed-object lane always decoded correctly, so
  a consumer that pre-escaped a `plaintext` field to survive the read drops the
  escaping. Alongside it, `reader.get_content` / `reader.getContent` returns a
  content field's `Content` corpus whichever lane stored it, so a consumer
  holding a corpus editor stops branching on the wire shape. `EditError` gains
  `FieldNotContent` (`edit::field_not_content`) for a declared type that is not a
  content leaf; core adds `Card::field_plaintext_content` (#1154). See
  `docs/migrations/0.99-to-0.100.md`
- refactor(core,wasm,python)!: card `$id` is removed — the reserved key, its
  resolver (`Document::find_card` / `doc.cardIndexById` / `doc.card_index_by_id`),
  the uniqueness contract (`EditError::CardIdCollision` / `EmptyCardId`, the
  `parse::card_id_*` warnings, the storage rejection), `Card::id` /
  `Payload::{id, set_id, take_id}` / `Document::{set_card_id, remove_card_id}`,
  the `PayloadItem::Id` and `CardWire.id` wire members, and the projected `id` on
  both bindings' card shape. Nothing in the engine read it and it never reached a
  backend, so what is left after removing the machinery that served the resolver
  is `$ext` with a reserved name. A block declaring `$id` no longer parses and a
  blob carrying an `id` payload item no longer loads: a hard cutover, no
  tolerate-and-ignore window. Per-card consumer keys move to `$ext` under a
  namespace you own, with no uniqueness, no collision check, and no repair
  (#1151). See `docs/migrations/0.99-to-0.100.md`
- refactor(content)!: `Content`, `Line`, `Mark`, and `Island` take
  `#[non_exhaustive]` — the four public structs the 0.99 sweep missed, that pass
  having run as two issues split by crate. Their literals give way to `new` plus
  the `with_*` setters on the same terms as the rest of the API; every field stays
  `pub`, so reading and assigning are unchanged. `Delta`, `Segment`, and
  `BaseLengthMismatch` stay open deliberately and now say so in their rustdoc.
  A Rust source break only: nothing about the wire, the canonical bytes, or the
  bindings moves (#1146). See `docs/migrations/0.99-to-0.100.md`
- feat(core,wasm,python): `Diagnostic.args` — the facts `message` interpolates,
  keyed by name, so a consumer with its own string table selects a sentence by
  `code` and fills it itself. Values keep their JSON shape (a list arrives as a
  list, a count as a number), engine prose never rides under a key, and a
  formatter missing a key falls back to `message` wholesale. `prose/canon/ERROR.md`
  § "Diagnostic args" tabulates the keys per code and a test fails when code and
  canon disagree (#1130)
- fix(core): the `$quill` mismatch message and hint name the pairing rather than
  the verb. `check_quill_reference` gates every schema-bound door now, not the
  render path alone, so a `quill.parse` failure no longer reads "was rendered
  with". The codes (`quill::name_mismatch` / `quill::version_mismatch`) are
  unchanged
- test(fuzz): the resting-form invariant gains a target, stated as three
  properties — conform is a fixed point, parse-then-conform equals typed-write
  per content field, and a document through the markdown surface and back settles
  after one pass (exactly, for `plaintext`, whose codec is lossless both ways)
- docs: the cycle's stale pages are repaired. Both binding READMEs gain the bound
  door and the corpus read, `revise_field` is documented per declared type on all
  four surfaces instead of as a markdown-only richtext verb, and four canon claims
  that outran the tree are corrected


## v0.99.0 - 2026-08-01

The 1.0.0 API freeze lands ahead of the tag, and the content codec closes its
last open gaps. All breaking changes are covered by
`docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`. Stored documents are unaffected: a `0.98` blob
loads byte-identically and `0.99` writes the same bytes for the same content.

- refactor(core,content,pdf,pdfform)!: the public API opens. 75 public types take
  `#[non_exhaustive]` — nothing in the workspace carried it before — so an
  exhaustive `match` needs a `_` arm and a struct literal gives way to `new` plus
  `with_*` setters. `Backend` is sealed, `OutputFormat::ALL` and
  `Content::RESERVED_{MARK_TYPES,LINE_KINDS,CONTAINERS}` become slices, and
  `RenderOptions { .., ..Default::default() }` becomes
  `RenderOptions::default().with_output_format(fmt)`. Four stay exhaustive and
  say so: the storage DTOs, frozen per schema version, plus
  `quillmark_pdf::FieldType`, `KnownIslandType`, and `Fidelity`, where an
  out-of-crate `_` arm is silent (a field that draws nothing, an island dropped
  from the projection, a fidelity rung nothing warns about). The rules are
  canonized in `prose/canon/COMPATIBILITY.md` (#1090, #1103). See
  `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- refactor(core)!: the YAML engine leaves the public API. `QuillValue::from_yaml_str`
  and `QuillConfig::schema_yaml` return `quillmark_core::YamlError` instead of
  `serde_saphyr` types, so a `0.0.x` dependency release is no longer a break to
  `quillmark-core`. The message is sanitized (the engine's own Rust API names are
  stripped), and `from_yaml_str` gains the `MAX_YAML_DEPTH` budget its siblings
  already carried (#1099, #1101). See `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- fix(content)!: the reserved-name rule reaches the wire. `attrs` beside a
  built-in discriminator resolved to the built-in and dropped the payload in
  silence; the authored lane now refuses it on all four axes, where a host writes
  it. Reading never got stricter — a blob from before a promotion still opens.
  A table cell keeps its own unknown keys too, canonicalization now rewriting it
  in place rather than minting a fresh `{text, marks}` (#1084, #1085, #1086,
  #1092). See `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- fix(content)!: opaque payload depth is bounded at `MAX_JSON_DEPTH` (128) on the
  `Value` lane, where an unbounded one took the WASM module down with a
  stack-overflow trap rather than a catchable error. The WASM guard sits on the
  JS side of the boundary, since `serde_wasm_bindgen` recurses while building the
  value, and covers every door that takes opaque host JSON: `install` and
  `applyChange`, plus `makeCard`'s field values and `insertCard`'s payload items
  (#1093). See `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- fix(content)!: island `loss` becomes the fifth open set. An unrecognized class
  round-trips verbatim instead of being rewritten to `unrepresentable`, so merely
  opening a document no longer moves its content hash. `Loss` opens on the island
  `type` axis' terms rather than the block axes': it becomes an opaque string
  wrapper with `LOSSLESS` / `DEGRADED` / `UNREPRESENTABLE` consts, one value per
  wire string, so a built-in's name has no second spelling and needs no
  reserved-name rule. `Fidelity` is the closed view `Loss::fidelity` returns, and
  is where a consumer switches; `Loss` consequently loses its `Copy` derive
  (#1091, #1142). See `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- refactor(core,typst,pdf)!: workspace-internal seams leave the published
  surface. `quillmark-pdf`'s `reader`/`writer` modules and `quillmark_typst::emit`
  become `#[doc(hidden)]`; the op-wire encoders emit an unknown's `attrs` in
  caller key order, the redundant per-encoder sort having been dropped (canonical
  content bytes are unchanged, the terminal sort still running) (#1095). See
  `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- fix(wasm)!: a `Quill` or `Document` from a second copy of `@quillmark/wasm` is
  refused everywhere, as a `QuillmarkError` coded `runtime::foreign_handle` that
  names the cause and hints `npm ls @quillmark/wasm`. 0.98 half-worked there:
  `Engine` was duck-typed, so a quill from copy A rendered on an engine from copy
  B at a per-copy clone cache nobody could see, while `Document.equals`,
  `Quill.validate`, `Quill.resolve` and the typed writer met wasm-bindgen's bare
  `expected instance of Document` at a value that *is* a `Document`. The check
  covers `Engine` (`render`, `open`, `supportedFormats`, `supportsCanvas`),
  `LiveSession.apply`, the writer and reader binds, and the three by-reference
  core methods; a value that is not a handle at all keeps its own
  `runtime::not_a_document` / `runtime::not_a_quill`. Nothing changes for a
  one-copy install (#1132, #1136). See `docs/migrations/0.98-to-0.99.md`
- feat(wasm): `isUnknownLine` / `isUnknownContainer` / `isUnknownMark` /
  `isUnknownIsland` answer known-vs-unknown on each open set, so a consumer no
  longer enumerates built-in names in its own source. `ContentLineKind` is
  re-exported from the package entry point, so a `setKind` op type-checks without
  a cast
- feat(python): the Tier-1 gaps close. `doc.card(i)`, `doc.card_index_by_id(id)`,
  and `doc.seed_overlay(kind)` are the single-card, `$id`, and seed reads WASM
  already had, and the wheel ships `py.typed` plus stubs, so mypy and Pyright see
  real signatures where the surface used to resolve to `Any` (#1011)
- fix(typst): four quill-load defects — a skipped asset, an unparseable
  `typst.toml`, a skipped package file, a declared-but-absent entrypoint —
  become `RenderResult` warnings (`typst::path_skipped`,
  `typst::package_manifest`, `typst::package_entrypoint_missing`) instead of
  `eprintln!` that wasm32 has nowhere to print (#1102)
- fix(wasm): the npm package states the license the workspace actually grants.
  `package.json` declared `MIT OR Apache-2.0` where every Rust crate, the
  workspace manifest, and the only `LICENSE` file in the tree are `Apache-2.0`,
  and the package shipped no license text at all: `build-wasm.sh` copied
  `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`, neither of which exists. It now copies
  `LICENSE`, or refuses to produce a package
- ci: the release gates the tag actually needs. New `package` (builds every
  publishable crate from its own archive and asserts each ships its `LICENSE`),
  `msrv` (holds `rust-version` to something true), and `audit` (bare `cargo
  audit` over the lockfile) jobs; the workspace moves to edition 2024 and
  declares MSRV 1.92. The `semver` job is dropped — it compared the tree's
  unbumped version against itself — and `COMPATIBILITY.md` names the writer and
  reviewer as what holds the promise instead (#1105, #1106, #1107, #1108)
- ci: the rustdoc gate covers the whole workspace. A bare `cargo doc` walks
  default-members and never lints a crate outside it — the blind spot that let
  the `Delta` links rot on the WASM surface and four more in the published
  `quillmark-content`. `--workspace` needs no `--exclude` and covers the next
  such crate on the day it lands
- test(fuzz): the four JSON decode lanes the bindings expose gain coverage
  (#1104)
- docs(canon): `COMPATIBILITY.md` states the crate-API promise — what
  `#[non_exhaustive]` does and does not buy, when to mark an enum, and what no
  attribute sweep catches
- docs(all): the em-dash leaves comments and prose, folded to a colon, comma,
  semicolon, or parentheses across ~2900 sites. `dense-prose` banned it while
  every exemplar it named used it; the corpus now matches the rule. A handful of
  diagnostic and CLI message strings repunctuate with it (`edit::body_only`,
  `validation::must_fill`, the pdfform bind errors, `--help`); codes, severities,
  and paths are unchanged. The character stays where it is the subject rather
  than punctuation: the WinAnsi encoding table, the YAML en/em-dash fixtures, and
  `docs/migrations/` (#1135)
- chore(core): `serde-saphyr` moves to `1.0`. The two call sites that built
  `Options`/`SerializerOptions` with struct-literal-plus-`..Default::default()`
  now go through the crate's own `options!`/`ser_options!`/`budget!` macros,
  which the 1.0 release requires since both structs are `#[non_exhaustive]`.
  `serde_saphyr` types stay out of `quillmark-core`'s public API (see the YAML
  engine entry above), so nothing downstream moves

## v0.98.0 - 2026-07-28

Five breaking changes, all covered by `docs/migrations/0.97-to-0.98.md`.
Stored documents are unaffected: a `0.97` blob loads byte-identically and
`0.98` writes the same bytes for the same content.

- feat(core,content,wasm)!: the block vocabulary opens. A line's `kind` and a
  container's name join the mark `type` and island `type` as open sets — an
  unrecognized value round-trips opaque and renders as its nearest safe
  neighbor instead of failing the load, so adding a block construct is no
  longer a document schema-version event. `LineKind` and `Container` each gain
  an `Unknown { tag, attrs }` variant (exhaustive matches need an arm) and
  `Line` / `LineKind` / `Container` drop their `Eq` derive, matching `MarkKind`;
  `Invariant` gains `ReservedUnknownLineKind` / `ReservedUnknownContainer`, so
  an unknown may not reuse a built-in name. `ContentLine.kind` and
  `ContentContainer.container` gain an open TS arm, so a bare discriminant check
  no longer narrows — `isHeadingLine` / `isCodeLine` / `isListItemContainer`
  join the existing guards in `@quillmark/wasm/runtime`. `Loss` describes
  fidelity; it does not gate export (#1054). See
  `docs/migrations/0.97-to-0.98.md`
- refactor(core,wasm,python,cli)!: `OutputFormat::Txt` is removed — the Rust
  variant, Python's `OutputFormat.TXT`, the TS `'txt'` arm. No backend listed it
  in `SUPPORTED_FORMATS`, so every path reaching it failed at render time;
  `--format txt` and `from_str("txt")` now fail at the argument instead, and
  there is no replacement format (#1058). See
  `docs/migrations/0.97-to-0.98.md`
- refactor(typst,pdfform)!: `format_not_supported` was three codes for one
  condition. Both backends now emit `backend::format_not_supported`, alongside
  the sibling `backend::apply_unsupported` — route on the namespaced code
  (#1057). See `docs/migrations/0.97-to-0.98.md`
- refactor(core)!: dead public surface is removed — `ReadValue::as_text` /
  `as_value` (match the variants), `Quill::list_files` / `list_subdirectories`
  (`quill.files()` owns the walk), and `QuillValue`'s eight `Deref`-shadowed
  accessors (`QuillValue: Deref<Target = serde_json::Value>` resolves each call
  unchanged — no action). `prescan`'s helpers and `reader::err` drop to
  `pub(crate)` (#1066, #1064). See `docs/migrations/0.97-to-0.98.md`
- fix(python)!: rendered regions cross the boundary as `DocPath`. Python
  returned plate-space addresses no document API accepts; the plate→`DocPath`
  translation now lives in core as `regions_to_doc_path` and both bindings call
  it, so `RenderResult.regions[].field` reads `main.body` /
  `cards.<kind>[<i>].<field>` as WASM already did (#1063). See
  `docs/migrations/0.97-to-0.98.md`
- fix(content): three codec holes close. A mark spanning an island slot no
  longer swallows it; a `LineKind` that disagrees with its segment is caught
  (`Invariant::LineKindMismatch`, carrying a `LineKindMismatch` reason); and
  decode is bounded — `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` is enforced at the door, and a wire
  position is read checked rather than `as usize`, which on wasm32 landed
  `2^32 + 5` at position `5` (#1051)
- fix(content): export's verify-and-drop safety net is bounded per line rather
  than per mark; `CONVERT.md` states the import↔export coupling the net implies
  (#1052)
- fix(content): markdown import keeps a literal `*` that abuts strong or
  emphasis — `a***a**` imports as `a`, `*`, strong `a`, where the deleted fixup
  dropped the typed star. Removing it also fixes a backslash escape or entity in
  such a span re-entering the content as literal source bytes (#1053)
- feat(core): `FileTreeNode`, `QuillIgnore`, `QuillConfig`, the schema types,
  and `ValidationError` are nameable from `quillmark` and from `quillmark_core`'s
  root, so in-memory quill construction and schema reading need no direct core
  dependency (#1055)
- refactor(core,pdfform): `From<PdfError> for RenderError` replaces two
  byte-identical `map_pdf_err` copies; `lopdf`, `js-sys` and `wasm-bindgen`
  hoist into `[workspace.dependencies]`, the no-op `default-features = false`
  pins drop, and `publish` is explicit on every crate (#1070, #1064)
- docs(core): the card-kind validation line is documented where it lives —
  construction (`Document::make_card`, `TryFrom<CardWire>`) is permissive
  data-shaping and insertion is the gate, returning `edit::invalid_kind_name`
- docs(canon): `ERROR.md` stops documenting a `fmt_pretty_with_source()` that
  does not exist and states what carries the source chain: serialization to
  both bindings, no Rust formatter. `error.rs`'s divergent path-grammar copy
  gives way to a pointer at `path.rs` and the canon anchor table (#1061, #1069)
- docs(canon): prune — canon stops re-documenting what `docs/` owns and states
  each fact once; the lint checks truth rather than shape, and the CI job table
  lists every job
- test: test clusters go table-driven, wrong-altitude binding tests move down to
  core, tests that pin foreign behavior or assert nothing are dropped, and one
  walker and one quill builder replace the per-suite copies (#1060, #1056,
  #1065, #1062, #1067)
- ci: the zero-backend configuration is built and tested — `--workspace
  --all-features` forces `typst` on, so that branch never compiled (#1068)

## v0.95.1 - 2026-07-19



## v0.95.0 - 2026-07-19

- release: re-cut to finish binding dists after the first publish run cancelled mid-flight
- **breaking** typst: a present `date` / `datetime` field lowers to a click-to-edit value-object — `(value: datetime(..), display: (..args) => text(value.display(..args)))` — instead of a bare Typst `datetime`, so the rendered glyphs are born at a generated `text(..)` node carrying a region keyed on the field's schema path: a date placed by a vendored package, or a card's date riding a shared loop variable, is click-to-edit. A blank date stays `none`, so `!= none` guards hold. Plates migrate two shapes: `(data.f.display)("…")` (paren form — the stored `display` is a closure on a dict, not a method) and `data.f.value` for anything native (comparison, `.year()`-family components, datetime-consuming packages). The tonguetoquill flagship quills' `display-date` dispatches on `type(date)`, since their `datetime.today()` blank-date fallback stays a native datetime (#990)
- **breaking** core,typst,pdfform: split the `datetime` field type into strict `date` and `datetime` (#717/#799 resolved) — `date` accepts a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` and rejects any time component; `datetime` accepts offset-less wall-clock `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm[:ss]` (seconds zero-filled) and rejects timezone offsets, the space separator, fractional seconds, and bare dates. Offsets are rejected, never dropped (the engine does no zone math); storage stays verbatim; no truncation in either direction. A `date` lowers to the three-component Typst `datetime(year:, month:, day:)` (unchanged emission) and a `datetime` to the six-component constructor, carrying the wall-clock time. The transform schema marks `date` as `format: "date"` (keeping `format: "date-time"` for `datetime`), and the blueprint reads `date<YYYY-MM-DD>` / `datetime<YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm[:ss]>`. Most deployed `datetime` fields hold a bare date and migrate to `type: date` with byte-identical data; the fixtures (usaf_memo, cmu_letter) do so. No deprecation alias — `datetime` rejecting a bare date is the decided end-state (#991)
- **breaking** python: the binding commits to the typed lanes — field I/O flows through `quill.writer(doc)` / `quill.view(doc)` exclusively and `Document` is quill-free data and structure. Removed (WASM-only by scope, not lag — their audience is not a Python audience): the opaque field store (`store_field` / `store_fields` / `store_fill` and card twins), the content lane (`install` / `revise` / `apply_change`), the quill-free field reads (`get` / `get_card_field`), and the module codec fns (`import_markdown` / `export_markdown` / `rebase` / `map_pos`). The composable `$ext` / field-remove card twins fold onto a trailing `card=None` selector and `push_card` folds into `insert_card(card, at=None)`. Mirrored additions: `writer.revise_field` (the `Delta` receipt is not surfaced), `writer.add_card(kind, fields=None, body=None, at=None)`, `writer.card(i).kind`, and the `Writer` / `CardWriter` / `View` / `CardView` handle classes exported from the package (#970)
- **breaking** core,wasm,python: complete the `RichText` → `Content` residual sweep (#976 folds into #982) — retire the last informal-`corpus` / model-`RichText` *identifiers* the mechanical rename missed: `CorpusHit` → `ContentHit`, `EditError::CorpusApply` → `EditError::ContentApply`, `RichtextDecodeError::NotCorpus` → `NotContent` (the codec-specific `RichtextDecodeError` type itself is kept), storage DTO `CanonicalRichText` → `CanonicalContent` (serde is unchanged — no wire migration), and the model-generic Typst emitter `emit_richtext` / `emit_richtext_inline` → `emit_content` / `emit_content_inline` (they lower any `Content`, richtext *or* plaintext). Also fixes the `ParseError` display strings `richtext json …` → `content json …`, the doubled-word find-replace debris (`content content model` → `content model`), and stale prose/comments across canon and rustdoc. Schema/codec names are untouched — `richtext` / `plaintext` tokens, `FieldType::{RichText,PlainText}`, `field_richtext` / `FieldRichtext*` / `apply_field_richtext_change`, `richtext(inline)` — they name codecs, not the model. "corpus" is purged from the tree entirely, including the ordinary-English test-set names that meant a *collection* of fixtures (`fixture_corpus` → `fixtures`, `synthetic_corpus` → `synthetic_inputs`) (#982)
- **breaking** core,wasm,python: a schema-bound read view — `Quill::view(&doc)` / `quill.view(doc)`, the read twin of `quill.writer(doc)`. `view.get(addr)` interprets each field by its declared type (a `richtext` field → markdown, a `plaintext` field → its literal text via the plaintext codec, every other type → its canonical value verbatim), returns absent as `undefined` / `None`, and — the authority the quill-free `getMarkdown` lacks — throws `UnknownField` for a name the schema does not declare and `FieldRichtextDecode` for a content field holding an undecodable value. Core `TypedReader::get` returns a `ReadValue` (`Markdown`/`Plaintext`/`Value`); `view.card(i)` is the card cursor; core adds `Card::field_plaintext` (the `to_plaintext` twin of `field_markdown`). **`getMarkdown`'s field half retires**: `getMarkdown` / `get_markdown` / `get_card_markdown` are now body-only (WASM `getMarkdown` takes a `CardAddr`, a present `field` throws; Python drops the `name` parameter) — a field's markdown is read through `view.get`. The quill-free body projection stays on `Document` (#978)
- **breaking** content: one delta-application contract — implicit trailing retain is `try_apply`'s semantics (a short delta retains the untouched remainder; the error is over-consumption only), `apply` panics on an over-long delta instead of clamping (clamping is silent corruption), and `extend_to_base` is removed. `split_line` / `join_line` rebase marks through their one-char `\n` splice with `map_pos` — the same mapping the text-delta channel uses — so marks no longer drift across line ops and `apply_field_change` canonicalizes once (a single terminal normalize instead of one per stage); line sync rebuilds in one forward pass instead of per-`\n` `Vec` splices. Mark ops are specified in final-text coordinates (post-delta, post-line-op — the frame they validate against) (#926, #987)
- **breaking** core: storage blobs tagged `@0.81.0` / `@0.82.0` fail as an unknown schema version — the read-only `V0_81_0` / `V0_82_0` DTO trees and their forward migrations are retired (nothing persisted on this lineage predates `@0.92.0`; `0.82.0` was yanked). `V0_92_0` stays the oldest shape read, and its payload types back the current write path. DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md records variant retirement as the policy when no stored population remains (#929)
- **breaking** core,wasm,python: the markdown projection stops appending a trailing newline — `to_markdown` projects a *value*, not a file, so `field_markdown` / `body_markdown` (WASM `getMarkdown` / `exportMarkdown`, Python `export_markdown` / `get_markdown`) no longer grow a `\n`; `writer.set("subject", "Hello")` reads back as `"Hello"`, not `"Hello\n"`. The content fixed point is unchanged (import is newline-insensitive) (#965)
- **breaking** all: rename the content genus off its codec's name — crate `quillmark-richtext` → `quillmark-content`, type `RichText` → `Content` (and `RichTextLine`/`RichTextContainer`/`RichTextMark`/`RichTextIsland` → `ContentLine`/…), const `RICHTEXT_MEDIA_TYPE` → `CONTENT_MEDIA_TYPE` and its wire string `application/quillmark-richtext+json` → `application/quillmark-content+json`, `#[serde(skip)]` companion caches `FieldSchema::{default,example}_corpus` → `_content`, `SegmentMap.corpus: Range<usize>` → `.content`, Typst-emitter `EmittedContent` → `Emission` (it is markup + source map, not a Typst `content` value). Schema tokens `richtext` / `plaintext`, `FieldType::{RichText,PlainText}` variants, and the codec-specific `field_richtext` / `FieldRichtext*` / `apply_field_richtext_change` / `richtext(inline)` surface are unchanged — those name codecs, not the model. Canonical body JSON is nameless, so stored documents don't migrate; `contentMediaType` consumers pin to the new spelling. Retires the informal "corpus" noun to end the code/prose split (#976)
- **breaking** core,wasm,python: `getMarkdown` / `get_markdown` / `get_card_markdown` stop conflating an absent field with a present-but-not-richtext one — a present field that does not decode as richtext (a scalar/array/object a `storeField` wrote) now throws `FieldRichtextDecode` instead of reading back `undefined` / `""`; absence still returns the absent shape. Core `Card::field_markdown` becomes `Option<Result<String, RichtextDecodeError>>` (the projection twin of `field_richtext`). Rule: absence returns, mismatch raises; read the raw value with `get` (#968)
- feat(core,wasm): typed, anchor-preserving field revise — `TypedWriter::revise_field` / `CardWriter::revise_field` and `writer.reviseField` / `writer.card(i).reviseField` wrap core `Card::revise_field_checked` (diff-rebase surviving anchors, then schema-conform the result); the schema-bound verb lives on the writer, where the schema is (#957, #966)
- **breaking** wasm: the quill-taking `Document` methods become the hidden ABI under the writer — `commitField` / `commitFields` / `addCard` → `_commitField` / `_commitFields` / `_addCard`, dropped from the `.d.ts`; remove `doc.reviseChecked` (no runtime consumer — use `writer.reviseField`). The visible `Document` class then carries zero quill-taking methods (#966)
- **breaking** core: rename `EditError::BodyImport` → `EditError::Import` (message `body import failed:` → `markdown import failed:`) — the variant also fires on field-path imports (`revise_field`), where "body" misnamed it (#966)
- **breaking** wasm: fold `pushCard` into `insertCard(card, at?)` — one insertion verb per lane, absent `at` appends; `insertCard`'s parameters reorder to `(card, at?)`. Delete the deprecated `replaceBody` alias (use `revise({}, md)` or `writer.setBody`) (#961)
- feat(core,wasm): positioned card insert — `TypedWriter::add_card` / `writer.addCard` and the `addCard` ABI take an `at` position, so a positioned typed insert is one atomic call instead of `addCard` + `moveCard`; add `TypedWriter::remove_card` (mirrors JS `writer.removeCard`) and a JS `CardWriter.kind` getter (mirrors core `CardWriter::kind()`) (#961)
- **breaking** core: `Payload::insert` / `insert_fill` now validate the field-name and value-depth invariant at the boundary and return `Result<_, FieldViolation>`, closing the `payload_mut().insert(...)` hole that let a direct caller build an invalid document; pre-validated internal callers use the new `pub(crate)` `insert_unchecked` / `insert_fill_unchecked` (#958)
- feat(wasm,core): single-card reads — `doc.card(i)` (throws out of range), `doc.cardIndexById(id)` (first match; `$id` is non-unique), and `doc.seedOverlay(kind)`, backed by core `Document::card(i)` / `find_card(id)`. Reading one card, resolving a `$id`, or fetching a `$seed` overlay no longer serializes the whole `cards` array or main card (#956)
- **breaking** core: parse warnings live only on `ParseOutput` — the redundant `Document::warnings` field + `warnings()` getter are dropped and `Document::from_main_and_cards` no longer takes a `warnings` param (`Document` `PartialEq` is now a plain derive) (#959)
- **breaking** core: collapse the two parse functions into one entry — `Document::from_markdown` and `Document::from_markdown_with_warnings` are removed in favor of `Document::parse(md) -> Result<Parsed, ParseError>`, and `ParseOutput` is renamed `Parsed`. A document-only caller writes `parse(md)?.document`. Bindings are unaffected: WASM `Document.fromMarkdown` / Python `Document.from_markdown` keep their names and their `doc.warnings` getter (#964)
- feat(wasm,python): keyed card reads `getCardField(index, name)` / `getCardMarkdown(index, name?)` (py `get_card_field` / `get_card_markdown`) — the card-indexed twins of `get` / `getMarkdown`, mirroring the `commitCardField` / `setCardField` write verbs so card reads no longer require a `payloadItems` walk (#953)
- feat(content,wasm,python): `LineOp::SetContinues { line, continues }` — hard breaks lower op-wise. Split, join, and a text-delta `\n` all mint `continues: false` lines, so a within-block hard break (a paragraph hard break, a code fence's interior line) had no op and fell back to a whole-install, losing that edit's identity anchors. Threaded through the wire codec into WASM `applyChange` (TS union updated) and Python; `continues: true` on line 0 is rejected with `ApplyError::FirstLineContinues` before the write, leaving the content untouched (#949)
- feat(wasm): the runtime root re-exports the edit vocabulary its own signatures reference — `Content` / `ContentLine` / `ContentContainer` / `ContentMark` / `ContentIsland`, `Addr` / `Delta` / `Assoc` / `LineOp` / `MarkOp` / `ChangeBundle`, `CardInput` / `PathStep` — as type-only exports (single entry point preserved; no `/core` subpath), with a presence guard so a dropped re-export fails `npm run typecheck` (#948)

## v0.94.0 - 2026-07-15

These notes cover everything since v0.92.1. No 0.93.x was separately
published — the 0.93 milestone folds into this release, so the upgrade path
from 0.92.1 is the `0.92-to-0.93` and `0.93-to-0.94` guides read in sequence.

- feat(wasm): the live-session / canvas-paint surface graduates from
  `@experimental` to stable — `Engine.open`, `LiveSession`, `apply` /
  `ChangeSet`, `paint` / `PaintOptions` / `PaintResult`, `PageSize`, and the
  `supportsCanvas` probe are now the committed preview API. The tag is dropped
  from the runtime `.d.ts` / `.js`, the wasm README, and `PREVIEW.md`; further
  shape changes follow the normal deprecation path rather than landing in any
  0.x. `Engine.render` / `supportedFormats` remain the one-shot path
- refactor(core)!: field ordering becomes fully structural — `ui.order` is
  removed and an authored `order:` is a load error. Field and card-kind display
  order is now the key order of the emitted schema (declaration order, backed by
  an `IndexMap`), and the auto-stamped `order:` integer disappears from
  `QuillConfig::schema()`; consumers walk the maps in key order instead of
  sorting on a stamped index. Typed-dictionary / typed-table-row properties
  render in declaration order, not alphabetically (#941). See
  `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- feat(core)!: a card-level `ui.groups` registry gives groups identity and
  order. `ui.group` becomes a validated reference to a snake_case id
  (`quill::unknown_group` for a dangling ref); the registry's declaration order
  fixes group display order, labels derive from the id with a `title:` override,
  and a bare label-as-identity group is deprecated (`quill::implicit_group`). A
  nested `ui.group` is a load error (`quill::nested_group_not_supported`) (#941).
  See `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- feat(core,typst,wasm,python)!: `plaintext` and a first-class `enum` join the
  schema. `plaintext` is navigable unformatted prose carried over the richtext
  corpus (a literal codec, with a `plaintext(field)` helper on the Typst side);
  `enum` is promoted to `type: enum` + `values:`, and the `enum:` modifier on
  `string` is deprecated for one release. `string` narrows to open scalar data
  (#938). See `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- refactor(core)!: `type: richtext(inline)` retires — declare `type: richtext`
  with `inline: true`. The old token is a hard `quill::field_parse_error`, and
  `inline: true` on a non-richtext field is likewise rejected. Blueprint still
  emits `richtext(inline)<markdown>` and `build_transform_schema` gains
  `quillmark:inline: true`, both derived from the flag; documents and corpus
  wire shapes are unaffected. See `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- refactor(pdfform)!: `form.json` slims to a binding layer (`form@0.2.0`). Bound
  `fields` drop `type` / `options` / `multiline` (derived from the schema
  field's kind, `enum` values, and `ui.multiline`); unbound widgets move to a
  `widgets` section; binding runs at load, so a bad `schema_field` fails with
  `pdfform::dangling_binding` / `pdfform::unbindable_field` instead of a silent
  blank. `form@0.1.0` is rejected and `$cards` absolute-index addressing is
  removed. Widget geometry is placed once at bind, not per render (#940). See
  `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- refactor(core,richtext,wasm,python)!: the binding write surface settles into
  two tiers over a document-free corpus codec. `quill.writer(doc)` (wasm and
  Python alike) is the documented default — typed `set` / `set_all` / `setBody`
  / `addCard` / `card(i)` and quill-free `get` / `getMarkdown` reads — layered
  over the corpus lane (`importMarkdown` / `exportMarkdown` / `rebase` / `mapPos`
  plus the addressed `install` / `revise` / `applyChange` verbs) and the opaque
  `setField` primitive. The eager `bodyMarkdown` / `fieldMarkdown` projections
  and the per-address body writers retire pre-release; `replaceBody` /
  `replace_body` / `update_card_body` alias for one cycle; richtext fields gain
  the anchor-preserving `revise_field`; the addressed `commit(addr, …)` is
  deleted (subsumed by the writer). A core-vs-bindings parity table governs
  drift (#925, #932). See `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- refactor(wasm)!: the `Card` shape splits by direction — a read `Card` always
  carries `body: RichText`, while `pushCard` / `insertCard` take a `CardInput`
  whose `body` still accepts a markdown string and whose non-`kind` fields are
  optional (#917). The card-write verbs become mechanical twins of their
  main-card names: `updateCardField` / `updateCardFields` rename to
  `setCardField` / `setCardFields` (#895). See `docs/migrations/0.93-to-0.94.md`
- fix(typst/overlay): underline / strike decoration ink no longer truncates
  `$body` field regions — the region geometry is taken before decoration strokes
  extend the glyph ink box, so a highlighted body field's box matches the text
  instead of the overrun (#937)
- chore: migrate org references `quillmark-org` → `borb-sh` across the tree
- fix(richtext): the markdown-export codec never leaks a delimiter into the
  corpus. An editor `apply_mark_ops` mark can wrap a span markdown can't
  represent (a `strong`/`emph`/`strike` edge on punctuation/symbols/whitespace,
  or abutting a literal `*`) — the run would re-import as literal `**`/`*`/`~~`
  text (bolding `a.` used to export `**a.**b`). `to_markdown` now verifies each
  rendered line by re-parse and drops any mark whose emission would alter the
  text, so the text always round-trips; only the unrepresentable formatting is
  lost. Import-domain corpora are unaffected (still an exact fixed point).
- feat(core,wasm,python)!: typed field writes via schema-carried types. One
  per-type write dispatch (`conform_value(value, schema, mode)`) unifies the
  render floor's coercion with a strict-write mode behind a `Leniency` flag; one
  typed writer per address, `Card::commit_field(name, value, &FieldSchema)`,
  dispatches on the schema — the write surface stays O(1) in field types. Adds
  `EditError::FieldConform` for non-richtext mismatches (richtext keeps
  `FieldRichtextDecode` / `FieldRichtextNotInline`). A schema-bound
  `TypedWriter` (`Quill::writer(&mut doc)`) is the front door: `set` / `set_all`
  resolve field types and strict-commit; a name the schema does not declare is a
  typo on the typed path, so it fails with `EditError::UnknownField` instead of
  falling to the opaque store (#918) — opaque storage stays available through the
  raw `set_field` / `setField` / `setCardField` verbs. Bindings gain
  `commitField` / `commitCardField` (wasm) and `commit_field` /
  `commit_card_field` (Python, net-new — Python had no richtext field writer).
  The pre-release richtext-specific writers are removed in the same cycle:
  `Card::set_field_richtext`, wasm `setRichtextField` / `updateCardRichtextField`
  — use the typed writer, which carries the `inline` constraint in the schema.
  Strict writes drop the render floor's cross-type `Boolean`↔`Number` coercions
  and fail a shape mismatch at the write, not at a later render (#893)
- remove(core,richtext,wasm)!: delete the incremental-edit surface — the
  per-field change log and everything layered on it: `richtext::ChangeLog` /
  `FieldChange` / `StaleRevision`; `LiveSession::revision` /
  `record_field_delta_at` / `record_field_change_at` / `ensure_base_revision` /
  `map_field_pos` / `apply_for_field_delta`; the WASM `applyFieldDelta` /
  `mapFieldPos` / `revision` and the `Delta` DTO; and the `revision` stamp on
  `RenderedRegion` / `CorpusHit` (and `FieldRegion` / `CorpusHit` on the wire).
  Anchoring a caret or selection across edits belongs to the editor's own
  transaction mapping (a ProseMirror / CodeMirror `StepMap`), not a parallel
  core-side position map: the bidirectional preview↔editor cursor bridge is
  `positionAt` / `locate` over the current compile, exact inverses that never
  consulted the change log. Whole-document `apply(doc)` stays the one edit verb.
  This dissolves #886's anchor-stranding half outright and drops the
  half-built delta path behind its per-keystroke-marshalling half; `Delta` /
  `diff` / `diff_import` / the mark & line op channels remain as the corpus
  writers' substrate (`replace_body`, `import_body_delta`, `apply_body_change`)
  (#886)
- feat(core,wasm): `field_boxes(field)` / `LiveSession.fieldBoxes(field)` derive
  the whole-field highlight — one union rect per page over the field's
  `span`-bearing content segments — so a "highlight the focused field" consumer
  stops reimplementing the span-filter + per-page union by hand. `regions()`
  stays the low-level disjoint truth (#829); the helper owns the union, and is
  content-only (a scalar-reference/widget-only field returns `[]`, its box being
  a single `regions()` rect). Core `field_boxes(&[RenderedRegion], field)` is a
  pure function so the one-shot `RenderResult.regions` sidecar gets it too (#884)
- feat(core,wasm): `CorpusHit.granularity` (`HitGranularity` = `cluster` |
  `segment`) reports whether `positionAt`'s `pos` resolved cluster-exact or
  floored to the containing segment's start (origin-less ink, a multi-line code
  fence's interior), so a caret UI trusts a `cluster` offset for the caret and
  treats a `segment` one as a segment selection instead of guessing. Additive-
  optional, omitted from the wire when the backend does not report it (#884)
- fix(wasm): `Engine.supportsCanvas` and `LiveSession.supportsCanvas` gain doc
  comments cross-referencing each other: the two are spelled identically but
  answer different questions (a pre-session backend estimate vs. this compile's
  authoritative answer, which can diverge — e.g. a 0-page document) — the
  divergence is now visible where each is used instead of only discoverable at
  runtime (#883)
- fix(core): drop two rustdoc intra-doc links from public items
  (`RichtextDecodeError`, `Card::set_field_richtext`) to the private
  `decode_richtext_value`, which `-D rustdoc::private-intra-doc-links` (part of
  the lint gate) rejects since the link can never resolve for a doc reader;
  reworded to a plain code span, matching the existing convention elsewhere in
  the same file for referencing a private helper from public docs
- fix(wasm): drop the `revision?` field from the public `CorpusHit`/`FieldRegion`
  types and the broken `{@link LiveSession.mapFieldPos}` / `.revision` references
  in `runtime.d.ts`. The delta API (`applyFieldDelta`/`revision`/`mapFieldPos`) is
  not forwarded through `runtime.js`, so no published consumer could reach the
  methods those fields pointed at, and the stamped `revision` was always `0` on
  the reachable read paths (whole-doc `apply` is revision-neutral). The public
  types no longer advertise a capability the shipped `LiveSession` doesn't expose
  (#850)
- refactor(core)!: `RenderSession` collapses into `LiveSession` — a persistent,
  incremental compiler that owns preview (#778). Reads (`render`, the canvas
  seam, `regions`) serve the session's current compile; the new transactional
  `apply(json_data)` recompiles in place (on `Err` every read keeps serving the
  last-good compile) and returns `ChangeSet { page_count, dirty_pages }` so a
  preview repaints `dirty ∩ visible`. Typst applies incrementally: the session
  persists its `QuillWorld` (fonts/packages/assets parsed once), swaps document
  data via `Source::replace`, and fingerprints visible page content for the
  dirty set; pdfform re-resolves + re-flattens (cheap by construction). New
  `RenderError::ApplyUnsupported` is the seam default. The callerless
  `typst_session_of` is removed. WASM: the `RenderSession` class is renamed
  `LiveSession` and gains `apply(doc): ChangeSet`; don't re-open per edit. The
  Typst backend now evicts `comemo`'s process-global cache after every compile,
  bounding memory over long editing sessions. See
  `docs/migrations/0.92-to-0.93.md`
- remove(dotnet)!: drop the .NET binding (`crates/bindings/dotnet`, the
  `quillmark-dotnet` crate, its `csharp/` managed layer, CI job, and NuGet
  publish workflow). Second-class and unmaintained relative to WASM/Python;
  removed rather than carried as bloat. Python and WASM are unaffected.
- refactor(core)!: field regions move from `RenderResult` to a session-level
  query, `RenderSession::regions()` (WASM `session.regions()`), and are keyed on
  the quill schema field path, not the backend widget. Only the interactive
  preview path wants region geometry; a one-shot byte render (PDF/PNG/SVG) does
  not, so `RenderResult.regions` is removed and the geometry is read once off the
  compiled session without a render. `RenderedRegion` (and the WASM
  `FieldRegion`) drop `name`/`kind`/`fieldType`/`value` for a single `field`
  carrying the schema address (e.g. `signature_block`); the pdfform AcroForm
  widget name no longer leaks. A region is emitted only for a schema-bound field
  — an unbound widget produces none. `RegionKind` is removed; the `quillmark-pdf`
  `FieldSpec` gains `schema_field` and `stamp`/`flatten` return plain bytes
  (`StampResult` is gone). Regions are geometry for overlays and canvas↔editor
  cross-navigation, never a compositing input (#773). See
  `docs/migrations/0.92-to-0.93.md`
- feat(pdfform)!: the `pdfform` backend now exports PNG and SVG as first-class
  `render()` output formats (`SUPPORTED_FORMATS == [Pdf, Svg, Png]`); PNG
  rasters at `RenderOptions::ppi` (default 144). The `preview` cargo feature is
  removed — the hayro raster/SVG/PNG seam is always linked, so SVG/PNG/canvas
  work out of the box rather than behind a flag. The `quillmark` crate's
  `pdfform-preview` feature is folded into `pdfform`; in the wasm crate both the
  `typst` and `pdfform` build variants link the `web-sys` canvas painter directly
- fix(quillmark-pdf): `find_dict_value` now walks the dict as strict
  key→value pairs, so a Name in *value* position (e.g. `/Subtype /Producer`)
  is no longer mis-matched as a key; the object/dict scanners also skip
  `%`-comments, so `endobj` or a key token inside a comment can't derail
  parsing of a base PDF. The `<<…>>`/`[…]` depth walkers (`extract_outer_dict`
  and `read_value_end`'s nested-dict/array branches) skip `%`-comments and
  literal `(…)` strings uniformly, so a `>>`/`]` carried inside a comment or
  string no longer truncates a dict/array and drops the keys after it
- feat(pdfform): add the Typst-free `pdfform` backend + shared `quillmark-pdf`
  AcroForm stamping spine; rewire Typst signatures onto the spine; thread a
  `regions` sidecar through `RenderResult` and generalize the raster-preview
  seam (#749, #750). See `prose/canon/ARCHITECTURE.md` and
  `docs/quills/pdfform-backend.md` for the shipped design.
- refactor(pdfform): PDF output is always an interactive AcroForm (Technique A).
  Value-flattening is internal machinery backing the SVG/PNG/canvas raster
  outputs, never a PDF deliverable. The public `RenderOptions.flatten` knob is
  removed across core and all four bindings (it was wired only in wasm, hardcoded
  `false` in Python, and ignored in .NET)
- fix(pdfform): the flatten path transcodes values to WinAnsi (with a
  `WinAnsiEncoding` font) so accented/Latin-1 text renders correctly in the
  raster output, and clips each value to its field box so long values can't
  overflow
- refactor(quillmark-pdf): hoist the shared PDF byte-serialization (object/text
  writers, `/Info /Producer` stamp) into `quillmark_pdf::writer`, consumed by
  both the stamp and flatten paths; `find_object_bytes` now matches any object
  generation and returns the live (last) revision
- docs(canon): canonize `$ext.editor.title` as the slot for a per-card display name
- refactor(core)!: remove the hand-set `Backend::supports_canvas()`; derive
  canvas capability from the one seam instead. `RenderSession::supports_canvas()`
  (authoritative, from `page_size_pt`) and `formats_support_canvas()`
  (pre-session hint, from output formats) replace it, so the capability can no
  longer disagree with what `paint` does. The engine and WASM `supportsCanvas`
  surfaces are unchanged in shape. See `docs/migrations/0.92-to-0.93.md`
- build(wasm)!: rename the WASM engine feature `render` → `typst` (now the
  default) and add a `pdfform` build variant, so a Typst-free
  PDF-form bundle can ship without Typst. From-source builders pass
  `--features typst` where they used `--features render`; the published JS API is
  unchanged. See `docs/migrations/0.92-to-0.93.md`

## v0.90.0 - 2026-06-10

- **Breaking (Rust API + bindings):** `Quill` is now engine-free, validated
  data. It no longer holds a backend; the `Quillmark` engine becomes a backend
  registry + render dispatcher. Rendering and capability move onto the engine:
  `render` / `open` / `supported_formats` / `supports_canvas` take `&quill`
  (JS: `engine.render(quill, doc)` etc.). The `engine.quill` / `quill_from_path`
  factory is removed — construct with `Quill::from_tree` (JS `Quill.fromTree`)
  or `quillmark::quill_from_path`. The backend-existence
  check moves from load time to render time (`UnsupportedBackend` now surfaces
  from the first engine call). `supportedFormats` leaves `Quill.metadata` (now
  pure config) for `engine.supportedFormats(quill)`. `Backend` gains a
  `supports_canvas()` capability method (default `false`; Typst `true`),
  retiring the `backend_id == "typst"` magic string. See
  [migration guide](docs/migrations/0.89-to-0.90.md).
- **Breaking (WASM/JS types):** `QuillMetadata` drops its `[key: string]: unknown`
  index signature. Code reading removed or unknown metadata properties (e.g.
  `quill.metadata.supportedFormats`) now fails at compile time with "Property
  does not exist" instead of silently returning `undefined` at runtime. Cast to
  `Record<string, unknown>` to reach extra `quill:` YAML keys if needed.
- **Breaking (Python API):** the Python binding adopts the engine-free shape.
  Render and capability move onto the `Quillmark` engine, taking a quill:
  `engine.render(quill, doc)` / `engine.open(quill, doc)` /
  `engine.supported_formats(quill)` / `engine.supports_canvas(quill)` (were
  `quill.render(doc)` etc.). `Quill.from_path(path)` replaces
  `Quillmark.quill_from_path(path)` — the engine is no longer a loader, and the
  loaded `Quill` is engine-free. `quill.metadata` no longer contains
  `supportedFormats` (read `engine.supported_formats(quill)`) and is now a pure,
  infallible config read. Backend resolution moves from load to render time:
  `UnsupportedBackend` surfaces from the first engine call, not from `from_path`.
  See the [migration guide](docs/migrations/0.89-to-0.90.md#python).
- **Breaking (Rust API):** `QuillSource` and the orchestration `Quill` collapse
  into one core type, `quillmark_core::Quill` (held by value; the vestigial
  `Arc` is dropped). `Backend::open` now takes `&Quill`; the consumer methods
  and the `seed` module move into core; `quill.source()` is gone
  (`quill.config()` is direct). Bindings already hid `QuillSource`, so JS/Python
  consumers are unaffected by the rename.
- **WASM packaging (single root export):** the root `@quillmark/wasm` import is
  now a hand-written **canonical layer** (`pkg/runtime/`) — it re-exports the
  Typst-less core's `Quill` / `Document` **verbatim** (same classes, no wrappers)
  and adds an async **`Engine`** (`render` / `open` / `supportedFormats` /
  `supportsCanvas`) as the canonical render API. The package `exports` map has
  exactly **one** public entry point, `.` (the canonical layer); the old
  `./render` and `./core` subpath exports are both **removed**. Engine-free
  editor/validation code (`Quill.fromTree`, `Document.fromMarkdown`) still loads
  only the small internal core binary (~0.66 MB gzip) — no backend is loaded
  until you render. The Typst backend binary is **private**
  (`pkg/backends/typst/`, not in the `exports` map): the `Engine`
  lazy-`import()`s it on first render, clones the quill/document into its memory as
  data (`Quill.toTree` → `fromTree`, `doc.toJson` → `fromJson`), and manages
  those clones internally (the validated quill clone is cached per instance;
  per-render document clones are freed) — consumers never import the backend or
  cross a WASM memory boundary themselves. `Quill.toTree()` is added to core for that crossing. A release-time
  size budget still guards the core artifact against Typst regressions.
- **WASM `Engine` (descriptor-only backend registry):** `new Engine({ backends })`
  takes backend entries in **descriptor form only** — `{ load, formats, canvas }`
  with `formats` and `canvas` **required**. The constructor validates each entry
  and throws (naming the backend id) at construction. The capability probes
  `supportedFormats` / `supportsCanvas` answer from this required manifest
  **unconditionally**, never loading a backend binary or cloning the quill. The
  bare-thunk loader form and its load+clone fallback path are removed.
- **WASM `Engine` (no invalidation API):** the unreleased
  `Engine.invalidate(quill)` / `invalidateAll()` methods are removed before
  release. The backend-clone cache is keyed on the canonical `Quill` instance in
  a `WeakMap`; a quill's contents never change after construction, so the only
  invalidation semantic is to drop/replace the instance (the clone is freed with
  it via the `WeakMap` + wasm-bindgen weak-refs). An explicit invalidation API
  will ship with its first real consumer. The load-bearing invariant — a
  canonical ref is immutable content within a runtime's lifespan — is now
  recorded in `prose/canon/VERSIONING.md` (Ref Immutability).
- **WASM `Engine` (session/canvas surface marked experimental):** `Engine.open`,
  `RenderSession`, `paint`, `PaintOptions`, `PaintResult`, `PageSize`, and the
  `supportsCanvas` probe are tagged `@experimental` in the shipped types and
  README: they ship ahead of their first production consumer (the designed
  canvas live-preview path) and may change shape in any 0.x release.
  `Engine.render` and `supportedFormats` are the stable surface.
- **WASM (typed error contract):** the root exports `QuillmarkError` — a
  structural interface (`Error & { diagnostics: Diagnostic[] }`) naming the
  shape every fallible method already throws — and an `isQuillmarkError(e)`
  guard to narrow caught `unknown`s. No runtime behavior change: the WASM
  layer still throws a plain `Error` with `diagnostics` attached (there is
  deliberately no error class — a structural check works across builds and
  WASM instances). Consumers can delete their hand-rolled
  `.diagnostics`-extraction casts.
- **Breaking (Rust API + bindings):** a document's `$quill` reference is now
  **enforced** against the loaded quill. Rendering with a quill whose *name*
  differs (`quill::name_mismatch`) or whose *version* falls outside the selector
  (`quill::version_mismatch`) is a hard error via the new
  `RenderError::QuillMismatch`, in both `render` and `dry_run`. Previously a name
  mismatch was only the `quill::ref_mismatch` warning and the version selector
  was unchecked. See [migration guide](docs/migrations/0.88-to-0.89.md).
- **Fix (WASM bindings):** `Document.makeCard`'s generated TypeScript now marks
  `fields` (and `body`) as optional (`fields?: Record<string, unknown>`,
  `body?: string`), matching the doc comment and runtime behavior. They were
  typed as required because `unchecked_param_type` drops the `?` marker; the
  bindings now use `unchecked_optional_param_type`. Callers can build a bare
  card with `Document.makeCard('kind')`.

## v0.88.0 - 2026-06-05

- **Breaking (bindings + Rust API):** a single canonical **`Card` wire shape** now
  flows in *both* directions. Core owns it as `quillmark_core::CardWire` (with
  `From<&Card>` / `TryFrom<CardWire>`); the WASM/Python bindings serialize and
  deserialize it instead of hand-rolling their own per-card translation. The
  flat `CardInput { kind, fields?, body? }` input type is **removed**:
  `Document.pushCard` / `insertCard` (`push_card` / `insert_card`) now accept the
  same `Card` shape they return (`{ kind, payloadItems, … }`), so a card from
  `cards` / `removeCard` / `quill.seedCard` feeds straight back in. Build a fresh
  card from a flat field map with the new **`Document.makeCard`** /
  `Document.make_card` helper. A stale `{ kind, fields }` object is now a loud
  error (`deny_unknown_fields`), not a silently-empty card. The seeded per-card
  getters `quill.seedMain` / `quill.seedCard` (`seed_main` / `seed_card`) are
  exposed on both bindings, mirroring the Rust `Quill::seed_main` / `seed_card`.
- **Breaking (Rust API):** `Document::push_card` now returns
  `Result<(), EditError>` and, with `insert_card`, validates that the card's
  `$kind` is a valid, non-reserved composable kind — the cards-list invariant is
  enforced at the edit op rather than incidentally at `Card::new`.
- **Breaking (bindings + Rust API):** the schema-aware **form view is removed**.
  `Quill::form` / `Quill::blank_main` / `Quill::blank_card` (and the
  `quill.form` / `blankMain` / `blankCard` bindings) are gone, along with the
  `Form` / `FormCard` / `FormFieldValue` / `FormFieldSource` types. Validation
  diagnostics now flow through `Quill::validate(&Document) -> Vec<Diagnostic>`
  (`quill.validate(doc)` in WASM/Python), which forwards the canonical
  `validation::*` diagnostics and keeps the non-fatal `validation::field_absent`
  completeness signal that `render` demotes. Field values/defaults/order are a
  `Document` × `quill.schema` join the consumer performs directly. See
  `docs/migrations/0.87-to-0.88.md`.
- **Breaking (diagnostics):** the validation code `validation::must_fill_absent`
  is renamed `validation::field_absent`. "Must-fill" is now scoped to the
  blueprint communication surface (the `<must-fill>` sentinel and the fatal
  `validation::must_fill_sentinel`); an *absent* field is a non-fatal
  completeness signal, not a fill requirement, since the render floor
  zero-fills it. The schema cell axis is renamed accordingly: the no-`default:`
  cell is **Unendorsed** (was "Must Fill"), the antonym of **Endorsed** —
  consumers routing on the old code or label must update. Internally
  `ValidationError::MustFillUnset { source }` splits into `FieldAbsent` and
  `MustFillSentinel` and the `MustFillSource` enum is removed.
- **Breaking (bindings + Rust API):** the `example` reference document is
  removed. `QuillConfig::example()` and the `Quill.example` (WASM) /
  `Quill.example` (Python) getters are gone. Its "show me a filled-out one"
  role is served by seeding — `Quill::seed_document()` / `Quill.seedDocument()`
  / `Quill.seed_document()` — which returns a committed `Document` rather than
  an annotated string. The CLI `render` with no input file now renders the
  seeded document. Nothing consumed the example document's annotations (the
  authoring surface is `blueprint()`), so the projection collapses into the
  seed: internally the `FillSource` fork in blueprint emission is gone and the
  blueprint always renders `default:` else the `<must-fill>` sentinel.
- **wasm:** lower the npm package `engines.node` floor from `>=24` to `>=22`.
  The runtime never required 24 — `--weak-refs` needs only Node 14.6+, and the
  `using` sugar that motivated the 24 floor is optional (a `try` / `finally`
  fallback covers Node 22). The aggressive floor hard-blocked installs on Node
  22 CI/dev images under `engine-strict`.
- **wasm:** `Document.makeCard(kind, fields?, body?)` now types `fields` as
  optional in the generated `.d.ts` (was required, contradicting its docs);
  omitting it yields an empty field map, as before.
- **docs:** fix the `Quill.schema` getter doc — the returned schema **includes**
  `ui` hints (it never stripped them); the stale "ui hints stripped" wording is
  corrected. The 0.87→0.88 migration guide now documents the `fill` flag's
  `!fill`-placeholder semantics and clarifies that seeding is example-filled,
  not a blank-form replacement.
- **blueprint:** flatten `group_fields` and drop the unused group label (#697).
- **docs:** document seeding (example → absent), fix a block-scalar prescan
  bug, and add commitment-ladder docs (#691).
- **docs(canon):** dedup field-resolution semantics into SCHEMAS (#692); note
  that released migration guides are era-accurate and immutable (#695); prune
  evolutionary information from comments and canon docs (#700).

## v0.87.3 - 2026-06-04

- Complete and consolidate the $ext mutator surface (#689)
- Complete the `$ext` mutator matrix with namespace-scoped removal and
  card-indexed namespace ops: `remove_ext_namespace` (Rust `Card`,
  `removeExtNamespace` WASM, `remove_ext_namespace` Python) plus
  `setCardExtNamespace` / `removeCardExtNamespace`. Deleting a sub-namespace
  is now the preferred way to clear `$ext` state — it preserves sibling
  consumers' slots and drops `$ext` entirely once empty, where `removeExt`
  remains a blunt clear-everything escape hatch.
- **Breaking (bindings):** the whole-map card mutator `updateCardExt` /
  `update_card_ext` is renamed `setCardExt` / `set_card_ext` for naming
  consistency with `setExt` on the main card.

## v0.87.2 - 2026-06-03

- Expose $ext write path through the editor surface and bindings (#687)
- Surface prose/canon entrypoint and fix canon documentation drift (#686)


## v0.87.1 - 2026-06-01

- Make $quill reference grammar a single source of truth (#684)
- Remove stale FieldType::Date references and add rejection test (#683)


## v0.87.0 - 2026-06-01

Arrays become first-class typed fields via a required `items` element
schema, datetime is unified under a single `type: datetime` accepting the
full YAML-1.1-style timestamp range (`FieldType::Date` is gone), and object
zero values are now shape-valid. This release tightens schema-load
validation in several places — empty `properties` maps and deeper array
nesting are now rejected — and consolidates the example/default conformance
checks behind one shared primitive. Documentation now ships from GitHub
Pages instead of Read the Docs.

### Breaking changes

These are schema-load cutovers for `Quill.yaml` authors; full before/after
steps are in `docs/migrations/0.86-to-0.87.md`.

- **Array fields now require an `items` element schema** (#672). Arrays
  previously carried a single untyped `Array` type; scalar arrays were
  never coerced or validated element-wise and were always annotated
  `array<string>`. Every array field must now declare `items`, and schema
  load rejects arrays without it. The bare-`properties`-on-an-array form
  (the old "typed table") is **removed** in favor of
  `items: { type: object, properties: … }`. Migration for a typed table:

  ```yaml
  # before
  rows:
    type: array
    properties: { name: { type: string }, qty: { type: integer } }
  # after
  rows:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties: { name: { type: string }, qty: { type: integer } }
  ```

  A scalar array adds `items` directly, e.g.
  `counts: { type: array, items: { type: integer } }`. Elements now coerce
  and validate against `items` (failing at the indexed path, e.g.
  `counts[1]`), and blueprint annotations reflect the element type
  (`array<integer>`, `array<markdown>`, …). Bundled quills and the
  `usaf_memo` golden schema are migrated.
- **`FieldType::Date` removed; use `type: datetime`** (#679). `type: date`
  no longer exists. `type: datetime` now accepts the full range from a bare
  `YYYY-MM-DD` date through RFC 3339 with offset (seconds optional, `T` or
  space separator). Datetime values gain calendar validation (e.g. Feb 30
  is now rejected), and JSON Schema output emits `format: date-time` for
  all datetime fields. The WASM `FieldType` union drops `"date"`. The
  blueprint hint is now `datetime<YYYY-MM-DD[Thh:mm:ss]>`.
- **Empty `properties: {}` on an object field is rejected** (#678). An
  empty properties map carries no information (the only conforming value is
  `{}`) and is almost always a mistake. It is now treated like a missing
  `properties` key and surfaces `quill::object_empty_properties`.
- **Deeper array nesting is rejected** (#673). The documented "one level of
  nesting" contract is now enforced in a single recursive pass, closing a
  gap where `array<object<array>>` and `object<array>` were silently
  accepted. A typed table row and a typed dictionary may carry scalar
  columns/properties only; deeper shapes fail with
  `quill::nested_array_not_supported`.

### Behavioral changes

- **Object zero values are now shape-valid** (#677). `zero_value` returned
  a bare `{}` for every object field, which failed validation on any object
  with `properties` (each absent property reported as `MustFillUnset`), so
  the zero-filled render path broke for object fields. An object with
  `properties` now recurses, zero-filling each property to its own
  type-empty leaf. `{}` remains the zero only for the property-less edge
  case.
- **`example:` values are now validated** (#680). The conformance check for
  `example`/`default` literals recurses into array items and object
  properties and validates datetime format — capabilities the old
  load-time path lacked, so previously-unvalidated `example:` values are
  now caught.

### Documentation & infrastructure

- **Docs hosting moved from Read the Docs to GitHub Pages** (#671). A new
  `docs.yml` workflow builds MkDocs (strict build as a PR check) and
  deploys to Pages on a published release; RCs are skipped. `.readthedocs.yaml`
  is removed and homepage/User Guide links point at the Pages URL.
- **Canon + docs: partial documents are first-class citizens** (#670). The
  docs and binding READMEs no longer claim Must Fill fields must be supplied
  before shipping. The only hard render gate is well-formedness (values
  coerce, no surviving `<must-fill>` sentinel); completeness is a hint
  surfaced by the form view. The `format-designer/` docs tree is renamed to
  `quills/`.
- A Migration section overview page was added and wired into the nav (#674).

### Internal

- Example/default validation is consolidated behind a single
  `validate_schema_literal` conformance core shared by `quillmark-core`
  config loading and the CLI `validate` command, with author-friendly
  diagnostics preserved (#680).
- Array and markdown handling collapse into recursive passes over the
  schema in both schema-shape validation and the Typst markdown transform
  (#673).
- Doc/comment fixes from the array-items review (#675).


## v0.86.0 - 2026-05-31

Documents now render even when incomplete, the canonical card-yaml fence
becomes a bare `~~~`, and the way placeholder/illustrative values are
produced is reworked. This release also fixes two markdown→Typst
conversion bugs and stamps a PDF `/Producer` field.

### Breaking changes

- **Bare `~~~` is now the canonical card-yaml fence** (was `~~~card-yaml`)
  (#662). Existing `~~~card-yaml` documents still parse, but `to_markdown`
  re-emits the bare `~~~` form, so a document's canonical bytes change on
  its first re-emit (relevant if you content-hash or byte-compare emitted
  markdown, or store blueprint goldens). A side effect: a column-zero
  `~~~` fence in a prose body is now read as a card-yaml block — use a
  backtick fence or a non-`card-yaml` info string (e.g. `~~~rust`) for a
  literal code block. Full details and corpus-migration steps:
  `docs/migrations/0.85-to-0.86.md`.
- **`fill_blueprint()` removed** from `quillmark_core` and `quillmark`,
  along with its re-exports (#657, #665). Callers no longer post-process a
  blueprint string: fillable/illustrative documents come from
  `QuillConfig::example()`, and the render path fills placeholders itself
  (see below).

### Behavioral changes

- **Incomplete documents render instead of erroring** (#665). An absent
  Must Fill field is no longer a render error. On the render path each
  schema field resolves to its authored value, else its `default:`, else a
  type-empty zero value — applied to the plate projection only, never
  persisted to the document. Only malformed input stays fatal: a surviving
  `<must-fill>` sentinel, or a value that won't coerce/validate.
  `quill.form(doc)` still reports completeness independently of the render
  gate.
- **`default` vs `example` clarified** (#665, #663, #658). `default` is the
  value most authors want and is interpolated when a field is omitted (an
  authored value always wins); `example` documents a field's shape only and
  never renders into output. Preview and illustrative fills now draw from a
  field's `example:` when present, falling back to the leanest type-valid
  value (`""`, `0`, `false`, `[]`, `{}`, first enum variant, empty body).

### Markdown → Typst fixes (#661)

- Code is now emitted as `#raw(...)` with a string literal instead of a
  backtick fence. This fixes fenced or inline code whose content contained
  a run of three-or-more backticks, which previously closed the block early
  and rendered as markup.
- Ordered-list start numbers are preserved — a list written `3.` / `4.` now
  renders starting at 3 instead of restarting at 1.

### New API

- `QuillConfig::example()`, plus `example` getters on the Python and WASM
  bindings (#665).
- `quillmark_core::zero_value` — the single source of truth for a field's
  type-minimal value, shared by blueprint emission and the render path
  (#665).
- `RenderOptions.producer` on the core, WASM, and Python render APIs (#656)
  — overrides the PDF `/Info` `/Producer` string, which now defaults to
  `Quillmark <version>` on every Typst-rendered PDF.

### Other fixes

- PDF rendering folds the `/Producer` stamp and the signature-field
  AcroForm injection into a single incremental-update pass, preserving
  Typst's `/Creator` (#656).
- `usaf_memo`: the signature widget is now overlaid at the 4.5in signature
  block (AFH 33-337) instead of the 1in left margin, and no longer consumes
  layout flow that could push the block out of position (#660); empty
  signature fields no longer carry the `APPEND_ONLY` flag (#654).
