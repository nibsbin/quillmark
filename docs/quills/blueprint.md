# Blueprint & Seeding

A quill's schema yields two ready-made documents: a **blueprint** (an annotated form to fill) and a **seed** (a starter document to edit). Both come from `Quill.yaml` alone: no one hand-writes them.

## Blueprint: the authoring surface

`blueprint()` emits an annotated Markdown document, the same shape an author writes: each cell holds its `default:` or is left empty, with descriptions and type hints as comments. It is the authoring surface for LLM and MCP consumers: answer the empty cells, write the bodies, and the structure and `$` metadata come for free. The emitted document is itself valid: it parses, round-trips, and renders.

```
~~~
$quill: cmu_letter@0.1 # keep verbatim
$kind: main # A letter on CMU letterhead.
# The recipient's name and full mailing address.
recipient: # array<text<plain>>
# The department name for the letterhead.
department: # text<plain>
~~~
```

Two annotation slots, disjoint by purpose: **leading `# …` lines** carry prose (the field's `title` and description as `# <title> — <description>`) plus an `array`'s `# up to <N>` cap; the **inline `# …`** at the end of a value line carries structure, the field's `# <type>[<format>]`. A matrix shows its whole roster there — `# matrix<flight_cc | dodin_ops>` — so a reader can tick a member without looking the schema up.

A matrix with columns, or an open one, adds an `# e.g.` line spelling one present member, `{flight_cc: {detail: …}}`, which names every column; an open matrix adds an item after it, `new_item: {title: text<plain>, …}`, the spelling of one a document adds. Each column shows its `default:`, else its container shape, else its `<type>[<format>]`. The members it shows are only an illustration, and this is the only `# e.g.` line a blueprint emits.

A card's own title and description ride its `$kind` line's inline slot, `$kind: note # <title> — <description>`, so neither reads as the first field's.

Two things in the own-line slot are not annotations. An `enum` declaring `variants:` shows the cells of the world its discriminant names live, and every other world's cells commented out under a `# when <MEMBER>:` header — the same cells, with a `# ` in front, at the column they would sit at. Choose that member and delete the `# `. A typed table without rows of its own is the live `[]`, or an empty cell where it is optional (`array<object>?`), since `[]` answers it, led by the whole field commented out, holding a row. Delete the live line and uncomment the block to add a row.

The reader's one rule: an empty cell (`title: # text<plain>`) awaits a value; a concrete value is the field's `default:`, shippable as-is. A blank `default:` (`""`, `[]`, `{}`) prints as an empty cell, since it renders as one. An empty cell renders at the field's blank, and nothing warns about it. Every body is empty too, and a kind taking no body closes its payload with `# no body`.

## Seeding: the starter document

Seeding materializes a real `Document` rather than an annotated string: the main card plus one card per composable kind, each carrying its kind's [`seed`](quill-yaml-reference.md#card-level-seed) and every other field left absent so the render floor fills `default:`, else the field's blank. Hand it to an editor as a "new document" starter, or render it directly.

| Projection | Intent | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `blueprint` | "give me the form to fill" | annotated Markdown string |
| seeding | "give me a starter document" | committed `Document` |

## Accessors

| | Blueprint | Seed | Empty |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | `quill.blueprint` | `quill.seed_document()` | `quill.empty_document()` |
| JavaScript | `quill.blueprint` | `quill.seedDocument()` | `quill.emptyDocument()` |
| Rust | `QuillConfig::blueprint()` | `Quill::seed_document()` | `Quill::empty_document()` |
| CLI | `quillmark blueprint <quill>` | `quillmark render <quill>` (no input file) | `quillmark validate <quill>` renders all three |

## The empty-document contract

`blueprint()` guarantees the emitted document renders, but that also depends on the quill's `plate.typ`. The quill authoring contract: **a plate MUST render an empty document** (just `$quill` / `$kind: main`, no fields) without error.

Under blank-filled render every absent field becomes its blank, so the empty document is the type-minimal valid input. A plate that renders it degrades gracefully on every valid shape. Two rules follow:

- **No template asserts a declared field is *non-empty*.** The schema guarantees presence, not non-emptiness.
- **A template branching on an `enum` covers `values ∪ blank` exhaustively.** The blank is valid present input for every enum, so an `else` fallback renders a variant nobody chose.

Bundled quills are checked against this by fixture tests; `quillmark validate <quill>` runs the same check over any quill, rendering the empty document, the blueprint and the seeded document through its backend.
