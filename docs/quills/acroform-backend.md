# PDF Form Backend

The `acroform` backend fills existing PDF forms: something the Typst backend fundamentally cannot do (Typst cannot embed a PDF page, so a Typst path would rasterize the form and lose fidelity). Instead of generating a page from a plate, `acroform` stamps a fresh AcroForm onto a pre-existing background and binds your document's values into the widgets.

It is Typst-free: an `acroform` quill never compiles Typst code and a form-only build never links the Typst compiler.

## The two-asset model

A `acroform` quill ships **two assets at its root** instead of a plate:

```
my-form/
├── Quill.yaml
├── form.pdf     # the stripped background: pages + chrome, no form fields
└── form.json    # the value-free field reconstruction spec
```

- **`form.pdf`**, the *stripped background*: the normalized form with its `/AcroForm`, widget annotations, and page `/Annots` removed (pure pages, rules, boxes, and labels).
- **`form.json`**, the value-free **placement + binding** layer: where each widget sits (`page`, `rect`) and which schema field it binds (`schema_field`). Everything intrinsic (widget kind, choice options, multiline, tooltip) is *derived* from the quill schema, not restated here.

At load the backend binds each field's value from your document data and writes the AcroForm **fresh** from `form.json` onto the background. It never reconciles a form already in `form.pdf`: a background that still carries one is refused (`pdf::existing_acroform`), since a second `/AcroForm` on the catalog is a dict the spec does not define and the old widgets would stay live in the page `/Annots`.

A catalog `/AcroForm null` is no form: ISO 32000-1 §7.3.9 reads an entry whose value is `null` as absent, so the background stamps and the fresh `/AcroForm` replaces the null entry. A reference to a `null` object, or to an object the file does not hold, is `null` too (§7.3.10), so `/AcroForm 7 0 R` over `7 0 obj null endobj` is no form either. Every optional entry the backend reads off `form.pdf` reads a `null` the same way, written directly or referenced.

The background's cross-reference data is a classic `xref` table. One held in a cross-reference stream, or a hybrid file whose trailer names `/XRefStm` or whose `/Prev` chain reaches such a stream, is refused as `pdf::xref_stream`: objects inside an object stream are invisible to the stamp. `qpdf --object-streams=disable in.pdf form.pdf` writes a classic table.

Nulling the key (PyMuPDF's `xref_set_key` sets a key to `null` rather than deleting it) strips the catalog entry alone, and the old widget annotations stay live in the page `/Annots`. A background whose page `/Annots` hold a `/Subtype /Widget`, written directly or referenced, is refused as `pdf::existing_acroform` too, whatever its catalog holds, and the message names the page.

!!! note "Where the assets come from"
    Producing a clean `form.pdf` + `form.json` from a raw source PDF (decrypt, strip, extract, verify) is the job of a separate *quillification* layer and is out of scope for the engine; the engine checks the result of the stripping, not how it was reached. V1 quills hand-author both assets; the `sample_form` fixture in `crates/fixtures/resources/quills/sample_form/` is a worked example.

## `Quill.yaml`

A `acroform` quill declares `backend: acroform` and has **no plate file**. The document body is typically disabled: a form is filled from fields, not prose. Fields under `main.fields` define the document schema exactly as for any other backend:

```yaml
quill:
  name: sample_form
  version: 0.1.0
  backend: acroform
  description: "Demo PDF form filled by the Typst-free acroform backend, over every field type it binds."

main:
  body:
    enabled: false
  fields:
    full_name:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: Full legal name of the applicant. Binds the FullName text field.

    comments:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      default: []
      ui:
        multiline: true
      description: "Free-form comments; each element becomes one line of the Comments field."

    agree:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: Whether the applicant agrees to the terms. Binds the Agree checkbox.

    favorite_color:
      type: enum
      values:
        - red
        - green
        - blue
      default: red
      description: Favorite color. Binds the FavoriteColor dropdown.

    headline:
      type: richtext
      inline: true
      default: ""
      description: "Inline richtext bound to the Headline text field; lowered to plaintext."
```

See the [Quill.yaml Reference](quill-yaml-reference.md) for the full field-type vocabulary.

## `form.json`

`form.json` is a durable, version-controlled artifact: readable and diffable. It carries two populations: **bound `fields`** that reference a `schema_field` and inherit their widget kind from the schema, and **unbound `widgets`** with no schema field (a signer fills them), which declare their own `type`:

```json
{
  "schema": "quillmark/form@0.2.0",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "FullName",
      "schema_field": "full_name",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 100, "w": 340, "h": 20 }
    },
    {
      "name": "Comments",
      "schema_field": "comments",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 140, "w": 340, "h": 80 }
    },
    {
      "name": "Agree",
      "schema_field": "agree",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 240, "w": 14, "h": 14 }
    },
    {
      "name": "FavoriteColor",
      "schema_field": "favorite_color",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 280, "w": 340, "h": 20 }
    },
    {
      "name": "Headline",
      "schema_field": "headline",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 520, "w": 340, "h": 20 }
    }
  ],
  "widgets": [
    {
      "name": "Signature",
      "type": "signature",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 330, "w": 340, "h": 40 }
    },
    {
      "name": "SignerInitials",
      "type": "text",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 390, "w": 120, "h": 20 }
    },
    {
      "name": "SignerConfirms",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 430, "w": 14, "h": 14 }
    },
    {
      "name": "SignerRole",
      "type": "choice",
      "options": ["witness", "notary", "guardian"],
      "page": 0,
      "rect": { "x": 180, "y": 470, "w": 340, "h": 20 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note what is **absent** from the bound fields: no `type`, `options`, or `multiline`. `FullName` is a text box because `full_name` is a `string`; `Agree` is a checkbox because `agree` is a `boolean`; `FavoriteColor` is a dropdown whose options are the schema field's `enum` values; `Comments` is a multi-line text box because `comments` is a scalar array with `ui.multiline`. The two files cannot drift, because there is only one source of truth.

### Bound-field keys (`fields`)

| Key | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | The widget's `/T` entry: unique across **both** `fields` and `widgets`. |
| `schema_field` | yes | The document field this widget binds to. Resolved against the quill schema at load; a dangling path is a load error (`acroform::dangling_binding`), not a silent blank. |
| `page` | yes | 0-based page index into `form.pdf`. |
| `rect` | yes | `{x, y, w, h}` in **PDF points** (1/72"), **top-left origin**, page-relative (see below). |
| `tooltip` | no | Overrides the widget's `/TU`. When omitted, the field inherits the schema field's `description`. |

### Unbound-widget keys (`widgets`)

An unbound widget has no `schema_field`, so it cannot inherit a kind: it declares one.

| Key | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | The widget's `/T` entry: unique across both populations. |
| `type` | yes | One of `text`, `checkbox`, `choice`, `signature`. |
| `page` | yes | 0-based page index into `form.pdf`. |
| `rect` | yes | Same top-left geometry as a bound field. |
| `tooltip` | no | The widget's `/TU`. |
| `multiline` | text only | `true` for a multi-line text box. |
| `options` | choice only | The dropdown options, as bare strings. |

### Widget-kind projection

A bound field's kind is derived from the **capability of the resolved schema field**, not its `type` token. The projection is total, or the quill fails to load:

| Resolved schema field | Widget kind |
|---|---|
| has `enum` values | **choice**, options = the enum values |
| `boolean`, or a `matrix` member (its tick) | **checkbox** |
| `string`, `number`, `integer`, `date`, `datetime`, `richtext`, `plaintext` | **text** |
| array of the above (scalar or prose) | **text**: elements joined with newlines |
| `object`, `matrix`, or array of objects | **load error** `acroform::unbindable_field` |

A container has no widget shape of its own; the cells inside it do, and each binds at its own address. A matrix member's own address is its tick, a checkbox at `qualifications.flight_cc` checked when the document holds the member, and its columns are text widgets beside it (`qualifications.flight_cc.detail`). An open matrix fails to load (`quill::open_matrix_unsupported`): a form has no widget for an item a document adds.

`multiline` on a text widget comes from the schema field's `ui.multiline`, and a value holding a newline (a richtext of two paragraphs, a block scalar) widens it to multiline whatever the schema said, so the file shows every line the preview does.

A text widget takes a richtext value's plaintext: the backend draws paragraphs and nothing else. A heading, rule, code block, list, quote, table or image in a content field warns `backend::declined_construct` at `validate` and at render, once per field and construct. The text of a heading, code block, list or quote still lands as lines; a rule, table or image lands as nothing.

### Top-left coordinates

`rect` is authored **top-left origin**: `x`/`y` measured from the top-left corner of the page, the way a human reads a form. The corner is the one a viewer shows you — the page's canvas box, `/CropBox` intersected with `/MediaBox` — so a background cropped or shifted away from PDF user-space `(0,0)` (anything through `pdfcrop`, say) needs no adjustment on your side. The backend flips to PDF's native bottom-left origin when it builds the widget. You never reason about page height or coordinate flipping yourself.

A page whose canvas box is under a point per side carries no canvas to place anything on, and loading refuses it with `pdf::degenerate_page_box`.

### Schema versioning and unknown keys

`schema` follows the convention `quillmark/form@<version>`, hand-set at the last format change (never auto-derived from a crate version). The current format is **`quillmark/form@0.2.0`**. Unknown *keys* are **ignored, not rejected**, so the format can grow additively, but any other *version* is rejected: a `form@0.1.0` file (which restated `type`/`options`/`multiline` on each field) fails to load with `acroform::invalid_form_json`.

### Opinionated styling

The background owns all visual chrome; each widget is a transparent input over it. The backend therefore picks one house style (a standard font, auto-sized black text, a fixed checkbox on-state) and `form.json` carries **no** styling: no fonts, colors, borders, flag bitfields, or per-field appearance. Keep `form.json` to geometry and type.

## Binding values

Each field's value comes from the **resolver**: for every bound field, the backend dereferences its `schema_field` against your document data and coerces it to the field's derived widget kind.

- **Bound against the same validated data the Typst plate sees.** Schema validation, defaults, blank-fill, and scalar coercion are all inherited: there is no second data pipeline.
- **Addressing** is a shallow path rooted at a schema field name, optionally with an array index or nested key: `full_name`, `comments.0`, `address.street`. The path is validated against the schema at load: a `.N` segment requires an array, a `.key` segment requires an object, and any miss is a `acroform::dangling_binding` load error naming the failing segment.
- **Coercion is type-directed:**

| Type | Binding |
|---|---|
| `text` | String value; numbers/bools stringify; an **array joins with newlines** (one element per line: the multiline fill). Empty → blank. |
| `checkbox` | `true` → checked; otherwise unchecked. Binds a `boolean` field, which reaches here already coerced. |
| `choice` | The value must match one of `options` exactly, else the field is left blank. |
| `signature` | Never bound: always an empty, signer-fillable widget. |

- **Unbound = blank.** A field with no `schema_field`, or whose bound value is absent or `null`, renders empty.

### Card-instance addressing

A `schema_field` rooted at the reserved `$cards` key binds one card instance from the document's `$cards` array (the same array the Typst plate iterates), **by kind + index**:

- `$cards.indorsement.1.from`: the `from` field of the second card whose `$kind` is `indorsement`, skipping intervening cards of other kinds.

Absolute-index addressing (`$cards.0.from`) is **not accepted** in `form@0.2.0`: a widget's kind must be statically derivable at load, and only the *kind* names which schema field the slot binds (an absolute index does not, since the card at that position varies per document).

This lets a **static, fixed-capacity** form lay out a bounded number of card slots across its existing pages: each slot a bound field with its own `page`, bound to a distinct instance.

!!! warning "Static forms only"
    `acroform` stamps over a fixed, pre-existing page set. It never composes content, appends continuation pages, or merges PDFs. A document carrying more card instances than the form has slots is the author's concern, not the engine's.

## Signature fields

A `type: signature` entry in the `widgets` section produces a clickable, **unsigned** AcroForm signature widget. Open the result in Acrobat (or any reader that supports form signing) and the widget presents a "Sign Here" affordance.

The widget is unsigned: Quillmark performs no cryptography. To produce a signed PDF, run the output through pyHanko, Acrobat, endesive, or another signing tool.

## Output formats

The backend's formats are `[Pdf]`: the deliverable, always an interactive
AcroForm. SVG and PNG error with `backend::format_not_supported`, the code both
built-in backends share.

PDF is emitted whole, so a `RenderOptions::pages` selection errors with
`backend::page_selection_not_supported`.

**Canvas** is a separate surface from `render()`: it is the WASM `paint()`
raster path (`render_rgba`), not an `OutputFormat`, and this backend paints. See
[PREVIEW.md](https://github.com/borb-sh/quillmark/blob/main/prose/canon/PREVIEW.md).

The PDF is the real deliverable, and the canvas rasterizes the same stamp but for each checkbox's `/AP` `/N`, which there names only the state the box shows (the canvas rasterizer reads no state dictionary).

Each widget is a real field carrying `/NeedAppearances` **and** a baked `/AP` appearance stream drawing its current value. The two split the work: a viewer that synthesizes appearances (Acrobat, Chrome/pdfium, Preview.app, pdf.js's forms layer) rebuilds each value from `/V` and `/DA`, refitting it as the user types; a consumer that synthesizes nothing (a raster pipeline, Ghostscript, the canvas) draws the baked stream and shows the value rather than an empty box.

A checkbox bakes both of its states, checked or not: `/AP << /N << /Yes … /Off … >> >>`, with `/AS` and `/V` naming the current one. `Yes` draws the check mark and `Off` draws nothing, the background owning the box itself. A later stage that fills the delivered PDF toggles a box by renaming `/AS` and `/V`, as pypdf does, with no appearance to regenerate.

### Baked-appearance fidelity limits

The `/V` a stamped field carries is always faithful, and a synthesizing viewer renders from it. The **baked stream is an approximation** in three ways, because it commits to one encoding and one measurement where a form renderer would defer. In all three the delivered `/V` is correct, only the drawn pixels differ, and no diagnostic is raised.

- **Non-WinAnsi characters draw as `?`.** The stream encodes text as WinAnsi (CP1252). Any code point outside that range (CJK, emoji, and many symbols) is substituted with `?`, while `/V` keeps full Unicode (UTF-16BE). A field whose value is `日本語` shows correctly in Acrobat but as `???` on the canvas.
- **Justification is not applied.** The stream draws from the box's left edge; `/Q` (the `align` dial) moves the text only in a viewer that re-synthesizes.
- **Overflow is clipped.** A value wider or taller than its field box is clipped to the box by the appearance's `/BBox`, whereas a synthesizing viewer wraps or scrolls it. A canvas can therefore look truncated where the same field in Acrobat is complete.

Treat `/V`, not the drawn pixels, as the source of truth for what a field actually contains.

### Regions sidecar

Field geometry is a session-level query, not part of `RenderResult`: open a session and call `regions()` to get one entry per schema-bound field, keyed on its schema field path:

```rust
pub struct RenderedRegion {
    pub field: String,            // schema field path
    pub page: usize,              // 0-based
    pub rect: [f32; 4],           // [x0, y0, x1, y1], PDF pt, bottom-left origin
    pub span: Option<[usize; 2]>, // USV [start, end) of the covered content; None for a scalar/widget
}
```

`regions()` reads off the compiled session without producing another byte artifact, so a GUI can fetch geometry once and overlay it on whatever surface it shows (a `paint`-ed canvas or a rendered page), independent of which format it goes on to render. A field with no `schema_field` never surfaces a region. The `acroform_preview` example (`crates/quillmark/examples/`) opens a session for the `sample_form` fixture and prints its regions for cross-checking against a viewer.
