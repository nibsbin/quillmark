# Creating Quills

A Quill is a format bundle that defines how your Markdown content is rendered. This tutorial walks from an empty directory to a rendered PDF.

It builds a `typst` quill, which draws a page from a plate you write. If you already hold a PDF form to fill, the `acroform` backend fills that form rather than redrawing it: start at the [PDF Form Backend](acroform-backend.md), where stripping the form into a background and a field spec is the author's own work.

## 1. Create the directory

Start with this layout:

```
my-quill/
├── Quill.yaml
├── plate.typ
└── example.md    # optional: the quill filled in with made-up values
```

## 2. Write `Quill.yaml`

Create a minimal but complete config:

```yaml
quill:
  name: my_quill
  backend: typst
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: A simple letter format

main:
  fields:
    sender:
      type: text
      description: Name of the sender
    recipient:
      type: text
      description: Name of the recipient
    date:
      type: date       # a bare calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD); use `datetime` for wall-clock time-of-day
      description: Letter date
```

`name`, `backend`, `version`, and `description` are all required. `name` must be `snake_case`. Define your document's expected root-block fields under `main.fields`. Each field has a `type`, optional `default`, `description`, and validation constraints. Use `integer` for whole numbers only and `number` for values that may include decimals. For the full list of field types, UI hints, typed arrays, and enum constraints, see the [Quill.yaml Reference](quill-yaml-reference.md).

Use `default` for the value most authors will accept as-is (filled in when the field is omitted); the type's blank (`""`, `[]`, `0`, `false`) is how you declare "nothing" as that value. `default` is the only value a field declares; a format hint goes in its `description`. A field with no `default` renders as an empty cell in the blueprint (`title: # text<plain>`), and left unanswered it renders its blank. See the [Quill.yaml Reference](quill-yaml-reference.md#default) for details.

### Picking a text type

Three types hold text, and two questions pick one:

1. **Is the set of allowed values closed?** Then it is an `enum`.
2. Otherwise: **should `*text*` render as emphasis, or stay literal?** (`richtext` over `text`.)

`text` is one line and `richtext` one paragraph; `multiline: true` admits more, and a `richtext` declares `multiline:` either way. A name, a URL or a reference key is a one-line `text`, and an abstract or a summary is a `richtext`. The letter above needs no `richtext` field: its prose is the document body, which is already rich text. Both text types are click-to-edit in an editor preview with a caret inside the value; a plate that computes with a `text` value (`upper`, a comparison, `set document(author: ..)`) reads it through [`qm.str`](typst-backend.md#text-as-a-str).

Pick before a corpus exists. Changing a declared type reinterprets every value already stored in that field, and `text` → `richtext` is lossy: see [Choosing among `enum`, `text`, and `richtext`](quill-yaml-reference.md#choosing-among-enum-text-and-richtext).

When you declare an `enum`, list only the real choices. Every enum also accepts a **blank** (`""`) that Quillmark supplies — what a document says when nobody has answered — so you never declare it, and declaring `""` in `values:` is a load error. If the empty state is itself a decision worth recording, make it a member (`undecided`, `waived`), because the blank means nobody chose and a member means someone chose "none". See [the blank](quill-yaml-reference.md#the-blank-values-is-for-choices-not-for-the-absence-of-one).

## 3. Write `plate.typ`

The backend finds the plate by its name, `plate.typ` beside `Quill.yaml`. Your first plate template:

```typst
#import "@local/quillmark-helper:0.2.0" as qm

#set page(margin: 1in)

Dear #qm.ink(qm.data, "recipient"),

#qm.data.at("$body", default: "")

Sincerely,

#qm.ink(qm.data, "sender")
```

The helper is imported as a module, `as qm`, and every member is read through it: compute with `qm.data.x`, print with `qm.ink(qm.data, "x")`, which keeps the printed text the click-to-edit target for its field.

For the Typst release a plate compiles against, data access patterns, helper package details, optional fields, and `$cards` iteration, see the [Typst Backend](typst-backend.md) guide.

## 4. Write a document

Create a `document.md` that matches the fields you defined:

```markdown
~~~
$quill: my_quill
$kind: main
sender: Jane Doe
recipient: John Smith
date: 2026-01-15
~~~

Thank you for your time.
```

## 5. Render it

From the same directory, render the document:

```bash
quillmark render ./my-quill document.md
```

For command options and output controls, see the [CLI Reference](../cli/reference.md).

## 6. A second plate

The plate in §3 reads two fields. The next one has a date in it, a field the author may leave unanswered, a repeating part, and layout of its own; the [Typst Backend](typst-backend.md) guide documents each of those on its own. `status_report` is them together, short enough to copy whole.

Its `Quill.yaml`:

```yaml
--8<-- "crates/fixtures/resources/quills/status_report/0.2.0/Quill.yaml"
```

Its `plate.typ`:

```typst
--8<-- "crates/fixtures/resources/quills/status_report/0.2.0/plate.typ"
```

Seven constructs to lift from it:

- **A date that prints.** `qm.ink(qm.data, "issued", ..)` takes the field's *address* and returns content, so the printed date stays the click-to-edit target for that field. `qm.data.issued` is the `datetime` behind it: reach for that to compare, to take components, or to hand a package a date it formats itself. See [Dates](typst-backend.md#dates).
- **An enum left unanswered.** The blank is a value no `values:` list holds, so `qm.data.state != ""` guards it and an `else` on a branch over the declared values would render a state nobody picked. See [the blank](quill-yaml-reference.md#the-blank-values-is-for-choices-not-for-the-absence-of-one).
- **An enum's printed text.** `state` stores an id such as `at_risk`, and `state-text` maps it to the words the banner prints. Renaming the printed text never touches a stored document. See [Enum Constraints](quill-yaml-reference.md#enum-constraints).
- **A card loop.** `$kind` is document-defined, so `card.at("$kind", default: none)` reads it and every other kind falls through. A field declared on the kind arrives filled, which is why `card.title` is a plain read. See [Body, arrays, and cards](typst-backend.md#body-arrays-and-cards).
- **Printing through `qm.ink`.** Every iteration of the card loop reads through one loop variable, so `card.title` printed there names no card. `qm.ink(card, "title")` is the same text born in generated code, keyed on that card's own field, and `qm.ink(card, "due", ..)` formats the date the same way. Compute with `card`, print with `qm.ink(card, ..)`. See [Print with `qm.ink`](editor-regions.md#print-with-ink).
- **A claim on composed ink.** The banner's glyphs are drawn by the plate rather than by the field, so `qm.region("state", ..)` is what makes a click on them resolve to `state`. See [Tying Composed Content to a Field](editor-regions.md#tying-composed-content-to-a-field).
- **`#set`.** Page and text defaults are ordinary Typst. See [Typesetting](typst-backend.md#typesetting).

Both listings are included from `crates/fixtures/resources/quills/status_report/0.2.0/`, which the repository's quiver sweep renders.

## 7. Next steps

- [Quill.yaml Reference](quill-yaml-reference.md): full field types, UI hints, `card_kinds`, `typst` section
- [Typst Backend](typst-backend.md): data access patterns, `$cards` iteration, helper package
- [Quill Versioning](versioning.md)

**Tip:** A disk load walks the whole bundle. It skips a root `.git/`, `target/` or `node_modules/` and any `.gitignore`; anything else in the directory ships with the quill, so keep scratch files out of it.
