# Persistence

A `Document`'s in-memory layout tracks the evolving Quillmark model and is not a stable interface. To store a document (a database row, a cache, a message payload) without persisting Markdown (whose syntax also evolves), serialize to a **versioned JSON envelope**.

| Form | Round-trips? | Stable for storage? |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown (`to_markdown`) | yes | no: syntax evolves |
| Storage JSON (`to_stored`) | yes, lossless | yes: frozen per schema version |
| Values JSON (`reader.values()`) | the *document* does; the values canonicalize once | **no**: a consumer projection, lossy by design |

`quill.reader(doc).values()` is the shape a consumer reads and edits — content
as its codec's text, sparse, carrying neither anchors nor `$quill`. It is an
API payload, never a stored row: persist with `to_stored`.

## Round-trip

=== "Python"

    ```python
    blob = doc.to_stored()              # versioned JSON string
    # … store blob …
    doc = Document.from_stored(blob)    # exact reconstruction
    ```

=== "JavaScript"

    ```javascript
    const blob = doc.toStored();
    const doc2 = Document.fromStored(blob);   // or tryFromStored → null on bad input
    ```

Every blob carries a `schema` tag (`quillmark/document@<version>`). Readers dispatch on it, accept every still-supported past version by migrating forward on read, and **reject an unknown version** rather than guessing. The current tag is `quillmark/document@0.112.0`.

## Byte-stability

Within a schema version, serialization is **byte-deterministic**: equal documents produce byte-equal JSON, and the same document re-serialized under any later patch or minor release carrying the same `schema` tag produces the same bytes. This is load-bearing for content-hashing stored documents: cache keys, template-divergence detection. Only a `schema`-version bump may change the byte layout of a document the current writer produces.

A row still carrying an older schema tag migrates forward on read; that migrated form's bytes become stable once you **rewrite the row under its current tag** (read-repair).
