# Content → Typst Lowering

> **Implementation**: `crates/backends/typst/src/` (the `emit` module)

## TL;DR

The Typst backend lowers a `Content` value to Typst markup with
`emit_content`, which walks the content: lines, anchored marks, embedded
islands, and never re-parses markdown. Alongside the markup it records a
per-segment source map (`content ↔ generated` byte windows). This is the only
markup-producing path in the render engine. Markdown reaches the content once, at
ingest, in `quillmark-content::import`; the normative rules for *which* markdown
a content can hold live in [markdown-spec.md §6](../references/markdown-spec.md);
this page documents how the backend lowers the content it produces.

## Pipeline

```
emit_content(&Normalized) -> Result<Emission, EmitError>
  ├─ block walk    lines → headings, paragraphs, code fences, lists, quotes, elements, islands
  ├─ mark sweep    anchored marks → nested #strong[…] / #emph[…] / #link(…)[…] / …
  └─ source map    per-segment (content ↔ gen) windows + one (content, gen) pair per run
```

`Emission { markup: String, segments: Vec<SegmentMap> }`. The content is a
single Unicode-scalar-value (USV) `text` carrying `lines` (line attributes and
container nesting), `marks` (anchored `[start, end)` ranges), and `islands`
(tables/images at reserved slot chars). The walk is a terminator-model block
tree over `lines`; the inline pass sweeps `marks` and islands within each line.

A **segment** is a maximal run of lines joined by `Line::continues`: one
paragraph, one heading, one whole code fence, one block island's line. It is what
"paragraph-level" means against the content, and the unit a region keys on.

Only a `para` or `code` block takes continuations
(`LineKind::takes_continuations`), and a continuation stays inside one container
path. A heading and a rule are one line, and so is a `para` whose sole content
is a block island's slot — the kind cannot tell that one from prose, so
`Content::block_island_at` reads it off the island's type. Both emitters
render such a line alone, so a `continues` line after one would be text neither
projection reaches: `Content::normalize` clears the flag there, as it does on
the first line and across a container boundary. `LineOp::SetContinues` writes
what it is given and the mint settles it.

## Escape functions

Three escapers guard two Typst contexts; all live in `emit`:

- **`escape_markup`**: text in markup context. Escapes
  `\ // ~ * _ ` `` ` `` ` # [ ] { } $ < > @`, and the head of each shorthand
  Typst substitutes a codepoint for: `--` and `---` (dashes), `-?` (an invisible
  soft hyphen), `-` before a number (a minus sign), `...` (an ellipsis). What a
  shorthand leaves behind is too short to re-form it. Applied to plain text runs
  and to a table cell's text.

  **Stray newlines lower to a space.** Every character Typst's lexer reads as a
  newline besides `\n` — `\r`, VT, FF, NEL, U+2028, U+2029 — becomes a space.
  The content ingress drops or spaces all six, so one reaches the emitter only
  from a content built or decoded some other way. No escape neutralizes one: a
  `\` before whitespace is Typst's linebreak. One reopens `at_start`, so the
  text behind it parses as a heading, list or term marker; two in a row split
  the paragraph. One character to one byte, so the per-character span scan
  stays exact, and the space is trivia the line-anchor guard holds open behind.

  **Spaces hold their width.** Typst reads a run of spaces as one, so a space
  with another behind it becomes `~`: `a.  b` writes `a.~ b`, two spaces wide
  and still breakable at the last. Line layout trims a trailing `~` with the
  space, so a run at a line's end adds nothing.

  **Smart quotes are the quill's.** `'` and `"` pass through, so Typst's
  language-aware substitution applies and a quill chooses with
  `#set smartquote(enabled: false)`. Escaping them here would settle that for
  every quill with no way back — unlike the shorthands, which the lexer decides
  and no set rule reaches.
- **`escape_indent`**: the spaces, tabs and stray newlines opening a line,
  which Typst drops whole. `escape_markup` with every space `~`, so typed
  indentation reaches the page, cannot wrap off the word behind it, and keeps
  the span scan 1:1. A line opens at the line anchor below and behind a
  `#linebreak()`. A tab stays trivia: the editor draws it at its own width, and
  no one byte matches that.
- **`escape_string`**: text inside a Typst string literal. Escapes
  `\ " \n \r \t` and other control characters as `\u{…}`. Applied to `#link`
  URLs, code content, and code-fence language tags.

Both are position-blind. Typst's heading `=`, list `-`/`+`/`N.`, and term `/`
are special only as a line's first token, each firing on a space after it or on
the line ending there, so a text run landing in that position takes a single
`\` prefix. The byte sits outside every source-map run window, so
`generated == escape_markup(content)` stays exact. Unprefixed, a paragraph
holding one bare `/` is a term list whose colon is missing, and the compile
fails.

That position is Typst's `at_start`, and it is four places: column 0, a list
item's body head, the head of every content block `[…]` the emitter opens — one
per wrap, one per table cell — and the tabs behind any of them, which Typst
reads as trivia. A heading's body is none of them. A `~` from `escape_indent`
ends it. The guard lands on the marker rather than ahead of the tabs: `\`
before whitespace is Typst's linebreak, not an escape.

The same `\` guards the tail of a `#…` expression. Typst reads a `(` directly
after one as that call's arguments, a `.` before an identifier as a field
access, and a `;` as the expression's terminator, so an emitted `#raw(…)`, a
wrap's closing `]` and an island's `)` would each run on into the document text
behind them — or, for the `;`, eat the character. Trivia between the two ends
the expression on its own.

And a third time, at a **seam**: a position where the emitter writes nothing
between two runs, which an island this build renders as nothing (an image, an
empty table) leaves behind. The escapers are per run, so a
multi-character rule sees one side of such a join at a time and the pair
straddling it escapes neither: `a/`, that island, `/b` would write `a//b`, a
comment that eats the rest of the line.

Debug builds parse every emission with Typst's own parser: a syntax error there
is a lowering bug, never a document's.

## Element mapping

| Content construct | Typst |
|---|---|
| `LineKind::Heading{level}` | `=` … `======` (`level` × `=`) |
| `LineKind::Para` | inline content; a hard break (a `continues` line join) emits `#linebreak()`, a soft break is a space (both settled at import). A slot alone on the line is the island's block, lowered by the island dispatch below |
| `LineKind::Code{lang}` (code fence) | `#raw(block: true, lang: "…", "…")`; `lang:` emitted only when the language tag is non-empty |
| `LineKind::Rule` (thematic break) | `#line(length: 100%)` |
| `MarkKind::Strong` | `#strong[…]` |
| `MarkKind::Emph` | `#emph[…]` |
| `MarkKind::Underline` | `#underline[…]` |
| `MarkKind::Strike` | `#strike[…]` |
| `MarkKind::Code` | `#raw("…")` (inline) |
| `MarkKind::Link{url}` | `#link("url")[…]` (`escape_string` on the url) |
| `MarkKind::Anchor` | nothing |
| `Container::ListItem` (bullet) | `- ` |
| `Container::ListItem` (ordered) | `+ ` auto-numbered; the run's first item emits `N. `, which restarts Typst's running counter so an adjacent list numbers from its own `start` |
| `Container::ListItem{checked}` (task) | the item's marker, then `#_qm-task(done)[…]` around its body (see [Tasks](#tasks)) |
| `Container::Quote` | `#quote(block: true)[…]` |
| `Container::Element{element}` | `#_qm-element("name", (…))[…]` (see [Elements](#elements)) |
| `image` island | nothing, plus one `backend::declined_construct` warning per field (see [Declined images](#declined-images)) |
| `table` island | `#table(columns: N, align: (…), table.header(…), …)` |

Table alignment maps `none→auto`, `left`, `center`, `right`; the `align:`
argument is emitted only when at least one column is non-default.

The table's layout keys lower as:

| Knob | Lowering |
|---|---|
| `widths` | `columns: (2fr, 1fr, auto)`, a weight to `fr` and `null` to `auto`, in place of `columns: N` |
| `align` | `align(center, table(…))` under `context`, with `table.cell` set to the horizontal `align.alignment` the table stands in, so the placement moves the table and no text inside it, save a horizontal alignment the plate's own `table.cell` show rule sets |
| `headless` | `header` lowers as the first body row, outside `table.header` |
| a cell's `align` / `valign` | `table.cell(align: right + bottom)[…]`, `middle` as `horizon`, which Typst folds with the column's alignment; a value outside its set lowers as absent |

A table cell is canonical `{text, marks}`, lowered through the same mark sweep
as prose: a formatted cell reaches `#strong[…]` / `#emph[…]` / `#raw(…)` /
`#link(…)[…]`, not an escaped source slice. A `\n` in a cell's text is a line break and lowers to
`#linebreak()`, as a prose hard break does.

**Block quotes render** as `#quote(block: true)[…]`: the one lowering
divergence from a flat inline pass; a quote's inner blocks lower under the
block-level discipline.

**Every generated line opens at the enclosing list depth**, two spaces per item.
Typst ends a list at a block written to column 0, so one emitter rule indents
leaves and containers alike: what the content nests, the markup nests.

Anchor marks emit nothing; an `image` island emits nothing (see
[Declined images](#declined-images)).
Raw HTML other than an inline `<u>`, `<br>` (a hard break) and the `qm-*`
carrier (markdown-spec §6.4) never enters the content, so it is absent here; math and definition lists
enter it as literal text (markdown-spec §6.2, §6.3).

### Elements

An element lowers through one dispatcher the helper defines,
`_qm-element(name, attrs, body)`. It calls the renderer a plate registers under
the name in the helper's `elements` state as `render(attrs, body)`, else the
built-in `keep`, which holds its body on one page, else draws the body alone.
It reads the state's final value, so a plate's update may stand after the
content it renders:

```typst
#import "@local/quillmark-helper:0.1.0": elements
#elements.update(e => e + (stamp: (attrs, body) => text(fill: red, body)))
```

`attrs` is a dictionary of strings keyed by attribute name, sorted, and `(:)`
when empty: each attribute as the document stores it.

Where it draws the body alone, the dispatcher places a `<__qm_element__>`
metadata ahead of it carrying the name and the registry's keys. The compile
reads them back as one `typst::unregistered_element` warning per content field
and fallen name. It counts that name's runs in the field, and its hint names
`keep` and every registered name. The dispatcher reads one final registry, so
a name that falls through once falls through everywhere, and a field the plate
places twice counts once. A plate that means a name to draw plain registers
`(attrs, body) => body`.

An element's call keeps its run's structure in its `[…]`, so a run inside
a list item stays in the item. The dispatcher's bytes fall between runs, so the
source map holds no run for them.

### Tasks

A task item's body lowers into `_qm-task(done, body)`, which the helper
defines beside `_qm-element`. It calls the renderer a plate sets on the
helper's `tasks` state as `render(done, body)`, else draws a box ahead of the
body, ticked when `done`. It reads the state's final value, as `elements` is
read:

```typst
#import "@local/quillmark-helper:0.1.0": tasks
#tasks.update(_ => (done, body) => if done { strike(body) } else { body })
```

The call opens on the marker's line and closes after the item's last block, so
an item's later blocks and nested lists stay in it.

### Declined images

An `image` island lowers to nothing, and the compile that dropped it carries one
[`backend::declined_construct`](ERROR.md#warning-flow) warning per field:
`args` `{backend: "typst", construct: "image", count}`, `path` the field's
`DocPath`. Declined, not unknown — the count comes off `islands`, so an image
counts wherever it sits, and a field holding one says so rather than losing it
quietly.

No backend resolves such a `url`. A document is quill-free but for
`$quill`, which is a *selector* ([VERSIONING](VERSIONING.md)) — `memo@1` admits
1.0.0 and 1.1.0 alike — and everything else a document references is
self-contained or declared. A path into one quill's file tree is neither, and
no `DocPath`, `validate` signal or url space makes it either. A backend that
resolved the string would bind documents to a reading nothing versions.

### Island props

An island's `props` is a per-type canonical object: the shape this lowering
reads and the shape the WASM boundary pins:

- **`table`** → `{ header: Cell[], rows: Cell[][], aligns: Align[] }`. `header`
  and each row hold `Cell = { text, marks }` (marks lowered through the sweep
  above); `aligns` is one `none | left | center | right` per column. Import
  normalizes to a single column count: header, every row, and `aligns` padded
  to the widest, so `columns:` and `align:` agree.
  The optional layout keys `widths`, `align` and `headless`, and a cell's `align` and
  `valign` ([DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md](DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md) § "Content vocabularies"),
  lower as [above](#element-mapping); an absent one draws at its default:
  auto-fit, at the plate's placement, in the column's alignment, under a header row.
- **`image`** → `{ url, alt }`; `alt` is the empty string when the source omits
  it. No backend resolves `url` (see [Declined images](#declined-images)).

The `IslandType` dispatch (`crates/content/src/island.rs`) owns these shapes
engine-side; the WASM surface pins them as `TableProps` / `ImageProps` /
`TableCell` and types `ContentIsland.props` per the closed `type`
(`crates/bindings/wasm/src/engine.rs`).

## Mark sweep

Marks anchor freely and may overlap (Peritext semantics from an editor); Typst
markup nests. The sweep opens marks by priority `(start, longer-span-first,
kind-ord)` and closes-and-reopens deeper survivors at each overlap boundary, so
free overlap lowers to properly nested markup: `strong[0,4)` over `emph[2,6)`
on `abcdef` becomes `#strong[ab#emph[cd]]#emph[ef]`, bracket-balanced. `code`
marks render atomically as `#raw("…")` (their content is a string literal, so no
inner mark applies).

## Source map

Each segment records a `SegmentMap`:

```rust
struct SegmentMap {
    content:   Range<usize>,                                 // USV, the segment's content span
    generated: Range<usize>,                                 // bytes into `markup`
    runs:      Vec<(Range<usize>, Range<usize>, EscapeCtx)>, // (content USV, generated bytes) per text run
}
enum EscapeCtx { Markup, StringLit }
```

A **run** is one plain-text stretch between marks, islands, and line breaks;
its generated bytes are exactly `escape_markup(content_slice)` (or `escape_string` for code /
string-literal runs). Structural bytes: mark delimiters, container syntax,
`#linebreak()`: fall between runs, inside `generated` but under no run. This is the
only place a per-segment source map can be produced, because it is the only place
that both lowers the content and knows the resulting byte layout.

Per-character spans within a run are **recomputed**, not stored: a one-scan
treats the `//`→`\/\/` markup escape as a 2-char/4-byte cluster and every other
character as its own. The `escape_tripwire` test pins that scan against
`escape_markup` / `escape_string` byte-for-byte, so an escape-rule change fails
loud.

## Where markdown is parsed

The markdown engine (`pulldown-cmark`) appears exactly once in the workspace, in
`quillmark-content::import`, run at ingest. `import` normalizes, parses, and
lowers markdown into the content (markdown-spec §6 is its normative acceptance
surface); every downstream render walks the content. No render path parses
markdown.

The one other caller is `export` itself, deliberately: its safety net settles a
line's markdown by re-importing it and dropping marks until the text comes back
intact, because CommonMark's emphasis algorithm has corners no local rule
captures. So export's correctness is *defined* by import: the two codecs cannot
be changed independently, and `to_markdown` transitively depends on the parser.
A line's re-parses are bounded by a probe budget, not by its mark count; the
trade is stated in the `export` module doc.

## Codegen integration

`generate_lib_typ` (`helper.rs`) lowers each content field's content to a markup
**block** binding `#let _qm_cN = [ .. ]` via `emit_content`, then rebases the
emitter's segment map from block-relative to `lib.typ`-relative offsets, yielding
one `ContentMap { path, block, segments }` per content field. The generated
`data` dict references `_qm_cN`; a blank content stays an empty string literal.
The file parser parses each block once: no runtime `eval`, no `json()` blob.

## Gotchas

- **All code is `#raw(...)`, not backtick markup.** Both inline code and code
  fences put content into a string literal where backtick runs are inert: no
  delimiter can collide, and `escape_string` covers the only specials (`"` / `\`).
  The function form makes inline-vs-block explicit via `block:`. A fence buffers
  its lines into one string joined by escaped `\n`.
- **Ordered-list start.** Typst's `+` marker always restarts at 1. A start
  number `≠ 1` is preserved by writing the explicit number on the first item
  (`5. …`); Typst then continues the following `+` items from there.
- **List markers.** Bullet items become Typst `-`; ordered items become Typst `+`
  (its enumeration marker), not `-`.
