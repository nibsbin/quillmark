## TL;DR

Cards are structured-data blocks inline within document content. All cards are stored in a single `$cards` array on the plate JSON, discriminated by each card's `$kind` value.

## Card, row, matrix

**Main by default.** A document is a form on `main`, nested where its data
nests. Quillmark nests to any depth: a `richtext` at depth lowers as content,
and `refs.2.org` is a writable address. The card stream is the mechanism for
*parts*, not the only mechanism for nesting.

Three shapes, and what each one is for:

| Shape | Is | Spelled |
|---|---|---|
| **card** | a part someone writes | a `card_kinds` entry; a `~~~` block in the stream |
| **row** | a record someone fills in | an `array<object>` on `main` or on the card that owns it |
| **matrix** | a vocabulary someone ticks | a `matrix` field ([SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md#matrix)) |

A **card** is ordered among kinds of other sorts, carries a fence-native
`$body`, is retypable, and seeds per kind. A **row** is typed cells belonging to
one parent; a `richtext` cell is a row's writing surface, and its prose is a
quoted YAML scalar rather than a fence. A **matrix** is rows the schema
declares, plus any an open one's document adds; sparse data; and a total page.

**The test is a disjunction.** A unit that stands in document order among units
of other kinds, **or** whose substance is flowing prose, is a card; otherwise it
is a row. Both clauses hold. A page break, a rule, an inserted signature block
carry no prose and exist for their position: they are cards by the first clause,
and a row cannot sit between two cards of other kinds. A child whose body is a
memo's worth of prose is a card by the second, because one quoted line is the
wrong spelling for it.

**`quill::bodiless_card_kind`** is the loader's one view of this, at
`Severity::Warning`: a card kind declaring `body.enabled: false` draws it, with
a hint pointing at `array<object>` on the parent. A warning rather than a
refusal, because the loader sees the proxy and not the fact — whether a kind
interleaves is a property of documents and the plate, and nothing in
`Quill.yaml` says. A rule that observes a correlate advises. `main` keeps
`body.enabled: false` unwarned: a form has no root prose.

## Data Model

```rust
pub struct CardSchema {
    pub name: String,
    pub title: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub fields: IndexMap<String, FieldSchema>,
    pub ui: Option<UiCardSchema>,
    pub body: Option<BodyCardSchema>,
}
```

The display label for a card kind is `CardSchema::title`; see `title` below. Whether a card kind takes body content is `body.enabled`.

`QuillConfig` exposes the entry-point card as `main: CardSchema` and the additional named card-kinds as `card_kinds: Vec<CardSchema>`. Look up a named card-kind by name via `card_kind(name)`.

## Quill.yaml Configuration

```yaml
main:
  fields:
    # ... main-card fields ...

card_kinds:
  indorsement:
    title: Routing Endorsement
    description: Chain of routing endorsements for multi-level correspondence.
    fields:
      from:
        type: text
        description: Office symbol of the endorsing official.
      for:
        type: text
        description: Office symbol receiving the endorsed memo.
      signature_block:
        type: array
        items:
          type: text
        description: Name, grade, and duty title.
```

`title` is the kind's display label (section headers, chips, picker entries), decoupled from the snake_case map key (`indorsement`), which is the on-the-wire `$kind` discriminator, so authors can rename the label without breaking stored documents. It is a literal naming the kind: a `{field}` token is a load error (`quill::title_template`). A consumer labels an instance from its own values, so field order decides which value leads. It sits at the top level rather than under `ui` because `ui` keys never reach the blueprint, and the blueprint prints it on the `$kind` line ([BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md) § "Inline annotation").

## Public Schema YAML Output

```yaml
card_kinds:
  indorsement:
    title: Routing Endorsement
    description: Chain of routing endorsements for multi-level correspondence.
    fields:
      from:
        type: text
      for:
        type: text
      signature_block:
        type: array
        items:
          type: text
        ui:
          group: signature
    ui:
      groups:
        signature: {}
```

`QuillConfig::schema()` emits the schema (with `ui` and `body` hints retained) and `schema_yaml()` is the YAML wrapper. The output keeps the same `card_kinds.<name>.fields` shape as `Quill.yaml`: only the user-fillable fields, no sentinel discriminator. The `card_kinds` map key (e.g. `indorsement`) is itself the `$kind` discriminator value. The `card_kinds` key is omitted entirely when no named card-kinds are defined. See `SCHEMAS.md` for the full surface.

## Markdown Syntax

A composable card is a `~~~` block (the opener's info string is ignored),
optionally led by a `$kind: <kind>` system-metadata line. The kind surfaces on the plate
JSON as the card's `$kind` discriminator; the block's payload is the
card's YAML data, and the markdown after the closing `~~~` fence is the
card's body.

````markdown
~~~
$kind: indorsement
from: ORG1/SYMBOL
for: ORG2/SYMBOL
signature_block:
  - "JOHN DOE, Lt Col, USAF"
  - "Commander"
~~~

Indorsement body content.
````

See [`markdown-spec.md`](../references/markdown-spec.md) §3 for the full syntax specification.

## Backend Consumption

Cards reach every backend as `data.$cards`, an array of one object per card:
payload fields flat, `$kind` and `$body` present exactly where the schema
defines them. A `$body` is a canonical `Content` object, never a Markdown
string. [PLATE_DATA.md](PLATE_DATA.md) § Data Shape is the canonical
shape and the accessor rules; `Quill::compile_data()` returns that JSON, fully
coerced and validated.

The sigiled `data.$cards` here is plate JSON: glue delivered to the backend. It is a **different namespace** from the unsigiled `cards` in a `Diagnostic.path` (`cards.<kind>[<index>]`, the document-model anchor; see [ERROR.md](ERROR.md) § "Document-model paths"). The plate key is not renamed off `$cards`; the two namespaces are documented apart.

## Out-of-band Metadata (`$ext`)

Per-card editor state: display renames, collapse flags, agent
annotations, anything bespoke to a UI consumer: belongs in the card's
`$ext` system-metadata key, **not** in user fields. `$ext` is an opaque
mapping that round-trips through Markdown and the storage DTO but is
stripped from the plate JSON before backends see it, so
template renders are not affected by editor state. Consumers
namespace inside the map (`$ext.editor`, `$ext.agent`, …) to avoid
collisions when more than one tool carries state on the same card. See
[markdown-spec.md §3.3](../references/markdown-spec.md) for the full specification.

`$ext.editor.title` is the canonical slot for a per-card display name:
the label an editing surface shows when a user renames one card
instance. It overrides the per-*kind* `title` and, being editor
state, never reaches the backend.

## Per-kind Seed Overlays (`$seed`)

`$seed` is the structural twin of `$ext`: a system-metadata mapping carried on
the **main card only**, round-tripping through Markdown and the storage DTO and
stripped before backends, but the seeding layer *interprets* it. It is
**root-only** like `$quill`: a composable card carrying `$seed` is rejected at
parse, on storage load, on insert (`push_card` / `insert_card`, the
positional gate that also polices `$kind`), and by `store_seed_overlay`, which
writes only on a card carrying `$kind: main` — the root's own marker, so a card
reached through `card_mut` is refused after placement too. It answers
"what does a *new* card of kind K start with in this document": each entry,
keyed by composable card-kind, is a **sparse overlay** of the user fields (plus
an optional reserved `$body` string) a freshly-added card of that kind inherits.

**Twin in structure, not in key.** `$ext` is keyed by a free-form *namespace* a consumer owns and Quillmark never inspects; `$seed` is keyed by a validated composable *card-kind*, and its value is an overlay. The verbs follow the keys. `$ext` moves whole — `ext` / `store_ext` / `remove_ext` — because a map Quillmark never reads is one its consumer merges for itself: a namespaced write is the read spread over the new slot. `$seed` is addressed per kind — `store_seed_overlay` / `remove_seed_overlay` — matching the `seedOverlay` read and the `SeedOverlay` type.

````markdown
~~~
$quill: usaf_memo@0.2.0
$kind: main
$seed:
  indorsement:                 # keyed by card-kind; never "main"
    from: 49 FW/CC
    signature_block:
      - "JANE A. DOE, Col, USAF"
      - "Commander"
~~~
````

`Quill::seed_card(kind, overlay)` commits the overlay into the new card in
place of the kind's own `seed:` in `Quill.yaml`, the same shape, and the kind's
`seed:` when the document carries no overlay for the kind (see
[SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md) "Kind seeds and document overlays"). The block is
*sparse*: fields it does not name stay absent and resolve from the live quill at
render. The overlay is read off the main
card's `$seed` map (`Card::seed`, exposed as `card.seed` in the bindings) and
parsed by `SeedOverlay::from_json`; the consumer passes it to `seed_card`
(`quill.seedCard(kind, doc.main.seed?.[kind])`): a read of the document, never
a mutation of it. There is no dedicated `Document::seed` accessor: `$seed` is
read through the card, exactly like `$ext`.

The main card **carries** `$seed` but is never a *subject* of it: its keys range
over `card_kinds`, and `main ∉ card_kinds` (a `$seed.main` entry is an advisory
unknown-kind). Overlays are validated only on the editor surface
(`Quill::validate`, warning-severity, rooted at `$seed.<kind>[.<field>]`) and
**never gate render**: `compile_data` / `dry_run` ignore `$seed` entirely. Each
cell is judged as the **document** value it is — an overlay cell is what
`seed_card` commits into the new card — so the container spelling of a
variant-bearing enum and a present-null cell read here exactly as they read in a
card. A malformed overlay surfaces enforcement only when a card is actually
spawned from it, as an ordinary card diagnostic on that card.
