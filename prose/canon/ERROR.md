# Error Handling System

> **Implementation**: `crates/core/src/`

## TL;DR

Every failure travels as a `Diagnostic`: severity, namespaced `code`, message,
optional text `location` and document-model `path`. `RenderError` carries a
non-empty `Vec<Diagnostic>` and has no failure taxonomy beyond them:
consumers route on codes, not types. Warnings ride the same currency and
never block.

## Types

**`Severity`**: `Error` | `Warning`. Fatality is this two-value ladder and
nothing else: `Error` blocks the stage that emits it, `Warning` never does.
There is no lint-level configuration and no warning-to-error promotion; an
informational aside is a `hint` on the diagnostic it annotates, not a
severity.

**`Location`**: file name, line (1-indexed), column (1-indexed)

**`Diagnostic`**: severity, optional error `code`, `message`, optional `location` (text anchor: file/line/column), optional `path` (document-model anchor, dotted/bracketed path into the typed `Document`, set by schema validation/coercion), optional `hint`. `location` and `path` are independent and may co-exist.

**`ParseError`**: parsing-stage error enum, `InputTooLarge`, `TooManyFields`, `TooManyCards`, `InvalidStructure`, `EmptyInput`, `MissingQuill`, `InvalidQuillReference`, `BodyImport`, `PayloadNotMapping`, `MissingKind`, `YamlErrorWithLocation`; converts to `Diagnostic` via `to_diagnostic()`. The `InvalidQuillReference` case (`parse::invalid_quill_reference`) attaches the canonical `$quill` grammar (`quill_ref_hint()`) as the diagnostic hint. That hint is the single source of truth for the reference grammar: bindings surface it verbatim (e.g. WASM `Document.quillRefHint`) rather than re-stating the rule.

The `PayloadNotMapping` case (`parse::payload_not_mapping`) is a card-yaml payload that is YAML but not a mapping, usually tilde-fenced code. It locates at the block's opening fence, and its hint names the backtick fence, spelled with the opener's info string.

The `MissingKind` case (`parse::missing_kind`) is a mapping payload after the root that names no `$kind`: every block after the root is a card, and a card names its kind. The block is a card missing its kind line or tilde-fenced code whose text reads as a mapping, and the parser cannot tell which. It locates at the opening fence, and its hint names both fixes: the `$kind:` line, and the backtick fence spelled with the opener's info string.

The diagnostic's `message` is the variant's `Display` rendering, so the
`#[error]` attribute is the one place a variant's English is spelled and a Rust
caller formatting `{err}` reads the same sentence a binding reads off `message`.

**`YamlError`**: the one adapter every `serde-saphyr` error passes through. Sanitizes the message (the engine appends its own Rust API names (`from_multiple`, `DuplicateKeyPolicy`) which `yaml_hints::enrich_yaml_error` strips), derives the hint, and carries the 1-indexed line/column the engine located; `to_diagnostic(code, file)` renders all three. The emit side has no input to point at, so it carries neither position nor hint.

It exists so no public signature names `serde-saphyr`. A third-party error type in a published signature chains this crate's major to that crate's, and to the choice of engine at all; the workspace pins `~1.0` and keeps the engine an implementation detail. That promise covers the message as much as the type, which is why the sanitizer is inside the adapter rather than beside it.

Two surfaces return one directly (`QuillValue::from_yaml_str`, `QuillConfig::schema_yaml`); `QuillConfig::from_yaml_with_warnings` converts through it to `quill::yaml_parse_error`. The card-yaml path does not travel this way: it becomes `ParseError::YamlErrorWithLocation`, which additionally knows the enclosing block.

Its `line`/`column` are document coordinates, not block-relative ones:

- The engine reports a position inside the string it parsed: the fence content with its CRLF line ends read as LF, line-for-line, minus the whitespace `trim` takes off the front. The assembler translates that position onto the document.
- `to_diagnostic()` renders it as a `Location` against `DOCUMENT_FILE` (`input.md`). Markdown reaches the engine as a string, so the anchor names the input rather than a path on disk.
- The message names the block instead of repeating a number (`YAML error in the root card-yaml block: …`, `… in card-yaml block 2: …`). The engine's own snippet inside it stays block-relative, as the engine rendered it.

**`RenderError`**: the main rendering error, a struct carrying a non-empty
`Vec<Diagnostic>` (`RenderError::new` / `from_diag` / `coded(code, message)`
for the one-error-diagnostic case every engine-side refusal takes;
`diagnostics()` borrows,
`into_diagnostics()` consumes). There is no failure taxonomy beyond the
diagnostics themselves: the machine-routable identity of a failure is each
diagnostic's namespaced `code`, and consumers route on codes, not on a type.
Multi-problem stages (validation, quill config, backend
compilation) carry several diagnostics so every problem reaches the caller in
one pass. The first is an error. A `Warning` after the errors is one the
failing stage raised before it failed, carried because it can explain the
failure ([Warning flow](#warning-flow)). `Display` follows the count-based
message rule shared with both bindings: the primary diagnostic's message for a
single error, an `"<N> error(s): <first message>"` aggregate for more,
warnings not counted.

Notable codes: `quill::name_mismatch` / `quill::version_mismatch`, the
document is well-formed but paired with the wrong quill (see
[VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md)); `backend::update_unsupported`: the default
for a backend session that does not override the incremental-`update` seam
(both built-in backends override it); `backend::format_not_supported`: the
requested format is outside the backend's `supported_formats`, one code on
every backend so a caller matches the condition once;
`backend::invalid_raster_scale`: a `RenderOptions.ppi` or a canvas scale
that is not finite and positive, or that would rasterize a side of a page past
`MAX_RASTER_SIDE`, and on `paint` a scale under `f32::MIN_POSITIVE` — ppi and
canvas scale are the same quantity in two units, so they share the code, and
the refusal speaks the unit passed: its message names the value, and its hint,
past the ceiling or on `paint`, a value that fits, a ppi on an export
and a scale on the canvas;
`backend::page_index_out_of_bounds` / `backend::page_selection_not_supported`:
a `RenderOptions::pages` selection naming a page the document does not have, or
asked of a format the backend emits whole (PDF on both built-in backends), both
minted by the shared constructors in `crates/core/src/backend.rs`;
`engine::backend_not_found`: the quill's declared backend is not registered.

`pdf::*` is the AcroForm stamping spine's own namespace (`pdf::parse`,
`pdf::write`, `pdf::rotated_page`, `pdf::bad_rect`, …): `quillmark-pdf` carries
the code on its `PdfError` and the `From` impl forwards it intact into a
`RenderError`, so a spine refusal routes the same whichever backend drove it.

**`edit::*`: mutator diagnostics.** Document and card mutators fail with the
`EditError` enum (`crates/core/src/document/edit.rs`), one namespaced code per
variant via `EditError::code()` (`edit::invalid_field_name`,
`edit::unknown_field`, `edit::index_out_of_range`, `edit::field_coercion_failed`, …).
Both bindings stamp that code onto the `Diagnostic` they raise: the mutator
peer of the render-path namespaces. Identity is the code, never message text:
routing coercion-vs-undeclared is `edit::field_coercion_failed` vs.
`edit::unknown_field`, read off `diagnostics[0].code`.

Building a card from a `CardWire` (`insertCard`) is the same
surface reached without an address, so it refuses under the same codes:
`WireError` carries the `EditError` its addressed twin raises, and
`WireError::code()` is that code. Two of its codes are not `edit::*`, or not
reachable elsewhere. A malformed `quill` string carries
`parse::invalid_quill_reference` and the grammar hint, the code core mints
wherever a reference is parsed. And `edit::invalid_payload` names a malformed
item list rather than a malformed field (a duplicate key, a field count past the
§8 bound, a `$` entry twice, a comment spanning lines). Three of the four reach
this door alone; the count also reaches an addressed mutator, because it is the
one invariant a caller holding a `(name, value)` pair cannot check for itself —
so `storeField` on a full card refuses under the code the wire already spells
for it, anchored at the card that is full.

**`RenderResult`**: successful result carrying artifacts, output format, and non-fatal `Vec<Diagnostic>` warnings

## Warning flow

Warnings travel the same `Diagnostic` currency as errors, on these producer
families:

- **`quill::*` load warnings**: the second half of
  `QuillConfig::from_yaml_with_warnings`, carried on the loaded quill and read
  off `Quill::warnings()`, so every binding host reaches them. A warning here
  never fails the load. One code: `quill::bodiless_card_kind` (a card kind
  declaring `body.enabled: false`, which is the loader's one view of a row in
  card costume: [CARDS.md](CARDS.md#card-row-matrix)). It advises where a load
  error would overreach — the loader sees a correlate, not the fact.
- **Parse warnings**: the `warnings` on the `Parsed` that `Document::parse`
  returns (e.g. a `~~~` opener missing its blank line), which both bindings
  keep on `doc.warnings` beside the `conform::*` set `Quill::parse` appends.
  They report the load, so no render carries them: a revise or a store can
  change what the document holds after it. The CLI's `render`, which parses
  and renders in one command, prints them ahead of the render's. A tag warning
  (`parse::unsupported_yaml_tag`) anchors at the tagged node's `path`, a
  card's under its stored `$kind` as `pathFor` mints it. One on a `$` key or
  inside `$ext` or `$seed`, which have no document address, carries none.
  A body's markdown import adds `parse::dropped_construct`, one per construct
  it dropped, with its `count`, anchored at the body (`main.body`,
  `cards.<kind>[<i>].body`) after its card's tag warnings. The `construct` is:
  - a raw tag's lowercase name: `div`, a `qm-*` name outside the carrier
    grammar such as `qm-a--b`, or `qm-anchor` where its block drops
    markdown;
  - `qm-<name>` for an element tag that drops: left unclosed,
    self-closing, inside a line of text, or beside another tag in a block
    tight against markdown;
  - `qm-table` for a `qm-table` wrapper that drops whole;
  - `qm-table[<attr>]` or `qm-<name>[<attr>]` for one attribute that
    drops;
  - `footnote` for a footnote definition, which drops whole, any tag in it
    unreported, while a reference to it stays as text.

  A parse reports a body's drops alone, since it knows no field's type: a
  `richtext` field's markdown string reports its drops at its path from
  `Quill::conform`, which `Quill::parse` runs, and from `Quill::validate`
  while the field still holds the string.
- **`parse::dropped_construct` off a markdown write.** The diagnostic a parse
  adds, minted by `quillmark_core::document::dropped_construct`, also rides
  the write that imported the markdown. A revise returns it on its `Revised`
  receipt beside the `Delta`: unanchored from a `Card` verb, which does not
  know its address, and at the body or field from the typed writer and WASM
  `revise`. A whole-document revise (`Document::revise`, the writer's
  `revise_document`) carries the parse's warnings, then each revised content
  field's at the field, on `DocumentRevised.warnings`. `add_card` returns it
  at the placed card's body, WASM `importMarkdown` and `rebase` beside the
  content with no `path`, and Python's `revise_body` / `revise_field` /
  `revise_document` / `add_card` as a list. A typed `set` / `set_all` returns
  a `richtext` string's drops at the string's path (WASM `set` / `setAll`,
  Python `set` / `set_all`), and `add_card` its fields' ahead of its body's. A
  conform reports a string's drops beside its `conform::*` warnings, and
  `validate` a string's the field still holds. A card inserted with a string
  body drops without it.
- **`conform::*`: resting-form warnings.** `Quill::conform` returns one per
  declared content field whose value the strict write refuses, and
  `Quill::parse` appends them to the `Parsed.warnings` the parse produced. Each
  is the `edit::*` diagnostic that write would have raised, re-namespaced and
  demoted to `Severity::Warning` with its `args` and `path` intact: the value
  rests as authored rather than being refused or silently retyped, so the state
  is repairable. The walk is stateless, so a repeat conform re-emits the
  identical set. Its scope is the content fields: a field whose type tree bears
  no content leaf never enters the walk, so a scalar the strict write would
  refuse raises no `conform::*` warning. It reaches `validation::*` only if the
  *render floor* also refuses it (`validation::type_mismatch`); the floor is
  more lenient than the write, and what it adopts is valid.
- **Validation warnings**: `Quill::validate(doc)` returns every
  `validation::*` diagnostic, mixing severities. Severity is the class
  [SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md#what-blocks-a-render) assigns: an `Error` is
  malformed input, and the document does not render; a `Warning` is unclaimed
  input, which renders. The warnings are
  `cardinality`, `out_of_variant`, `unknown_card`, `body_disabled`,
  `unknown_field`, and the
  `$seed` checks, which warn
  whatever their class because no render reads `$seed`. Beside them it
  returns the `backend::declined_construct` warnings a render raises.
  The render gate consults only the fatal set. A one-shot render
  (`Quillmark::render`) carries every one of these warnings on
  `RenderResult.warnings`, the declines among the compile's and the rest
  ahead of them. A
  session carries none: its warnings are its current compile's, so its editor
  reads `Quill::validate` beside it. The CLI's `render` prints them
  ([CLI.md](CLI.md)). Values
  are judged in the form the render floor builds from them
  ([SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md) § "Type coercion").
- **`backend::declined_construct`: declined-construct warnings.** A backend
  that declines a construct outright says so itself: one diagnostic per
  (content field, construct) carrying `backend`, `construct` and `count` in
  `args` and the field's `DocPath` in `path`, minted by
  `quillmark_core::backend::declined_construct`. Raised at the compile that
  dropped the construct, so it rides the session's compile warnings, and
  `LiveSession` mints it from the plate data rather than the backend. The Typst
  backend declines `image` in content
  ([CONVERT.md](CONVERT.md#declined-images)), and the acroform backend every
  construct but the paragraph. `quillmark_core::backend::declines` is the
  table, keyed by backend id. `Quill::validate` walks the plate a render
  compiles, schema defaults and coercion applied, and returns the same
  diagnostics, byte for byte, before any render. A document the render floor
  refuses compiles nothing, so it draws none.
- **`typst::unregistered_element`: an element no renderer takes.** The Typst
  compile warns once per (content field, element name) the helper's dispatcher
  drew as what it wraps ([CONVERT.md](CONVERT.md#elements)), with the field's
  `DocPath` in `path`. The run count rides the message, and the names the
  plate renders ride the hint. It rides the session's compile warnings. The
  registry is plate code, so `validate`, which compiles nothing, has no twin
  for it.
- **Compile warnings**: the Typst backend maps the compiler's non-fatal
  diagnostics (font fallback, overfull pages, …) through the same span
  resolution as errors. They are state of the session's current compile:
  exposed via `LiveSession::warnings()` (the `SessionHandle::warnings` seam,
  default empty), refreshed by each committed `update`: a failed update keeps
  the last-good compile *and* its warnings, and appended to
  `RenderResult.warnings` on every `render()`, including the one-shot
  `open` → `render` path.

Ordering in a merged `RenderResult.warnings` is pipeline order: validation
warnings first, then compile warnings, with no dedup across families.
`backend::declined_construct` dedups within itself, per field: its producer
sees every occurrence at once, so the occurrences collapse into `count`.

A Typst `open` failing once its world has loaded, in codegen or the compile,
leaves no session to serve the quill-load warnings ([below](#typst)), so its
`RenderError` carries them after its errors. An `#import` of a package the
load skipped fails as `typst::file_not_found`, and only
`typst::package_manifest` says why. A failed `update` carries none: the
session goes on serving them.

## Bindings Error Delegation

Python and WASM bindings delegate to core types:

- **Python**: `PyDiagnostic` wraps `Diagnostic`. Every raised exception is `QuillmarkError` (a single type). Every exception carries a `diagnostics` list; `str(exc)` follows the shared count-based message rule.
- **WASM**: `WasmError` carries a single `diagnostics: Vec<Diagnostic>` (always non-empty). The thrown JS `Error` has a `.diagnostics` array attached and a `.message` derived from `diagnostics` by the same count-based rule. Consumers read `err.diagnostics[0]` for the primary diagnostic and iterate `err.diagnostics` for the rest. Parse failures (`Document.fromMarkdown`) carry the same shape; including the `parse::input_too_large` diagnostic for inputs over `MAX_INPUT_SIZE` (10 MiB) and the `edit::*` codes for post-parse mutators.

**WASM delivery follows the function kind, not the failure kind.** A synchronous verb throws; a promise-returning verb rejects; nothing does both.

- The promise-returning surface is `init` plus the four `Engine` verbs (`render`, `open`, `load`, `supportedFormats`). A programming error reached through one of them (a handle that is not this copy's, `runtime::not_a_quill` / `runtime::not_a_document`; an unregistered backend, `engine::backend_not_found`) arrives as a rejection like any other failure.
- `init` is the one promise-returning export not declared `async`: its memo is returned by identity rather than re-wrapped per call. Its conflict guard therefore returns `Promise.reject(runtime::init_conflict)` where an `async` body would have converted a throw.
- A synchronous throw from `init` would lose the rule at exactly one export, and silently: `Promise<void>` cannot declare it, so the declaration invites `init(BYTES).catch(…)` and the throw escapes.

## Backend Error Mapping

### Typst

Typst diagnostics mapped via `map_typst_errors()`:
- Severity levels mapped (Error/Warning)
- Spans resolved to file/line/column
- Error codes: a **closed set**, keyed off the message's shape
- Hints: Typst's first, else one the mapping verifies (below)

Typst has no error codes of its own, so the mapping mints one. It classifies
rather than quotes: `typst::file_not_found` (a file the world refused),
`typst::unknown_variable` (a plate naming a symbol that is not in scope),
`typst::type_error` (a value that is not what the position wanted), and
`typst::compile` for every message the set does not name. Errors and warnings
are classified alike.

The residual bucket is what keeps the set closed, and a code spelled by the
message instead is what it rules out: that would carry author-supplied text —
a searched path, a symbol name — into a routing key, and give the key one
value per input. Typst's sentence stays in `message`, which is where the
searched path is read. Classification reads that English, so a reworded
message degrades to `typst::compile` rather than minting a code of its own.

Typst hints nothing for a missing file, so the mapping adds one hint of its
own. A bare path resolves from the directory of the file naming it, so a module
below the quill root misses `assets/…` at the root. A `typst::file_not_found`
raised there hints the rooted spelling (`/assets/logo.svg`) when the world loads
a file at it, and only then.

See `crates/backends/typst/src/error_mapping.rs`.

**Quill-load warnings** are the backend's other warning source, hand-coded
rather than derived from a Typst diagnostic: `typst::path_skipped` (a file
Typst's `VirtualPath` rejected: asset or package file alike),
`typst::package_manifest`, and `typst::package_entrypoint_missing`. Each marks a
file the world had to skip, which otherwise surfaces only as an unresolved
`#import` pointing at the plate instead of at the defect. The fourth,
`typst::unknown_key`, marks a key under `typst:` the backend never
reads: core stores that section verbatim, so nothing else would report it. They are properties of the quill, not of a compile, so
`QuillWorld` holds them and the session serves them ahead of every compile's
own: an `update` swaps the compile half and keeps these.

**Plate refusals** fail `open` and `workspace` before a world exists:
`typst::plate_missing` (`typst.plate_file` names no file in the quill),
`typst::plate_path_invalid` (it names one at a path Typst's `VirtualPath`
refuses, such as one holding a `\`), and `typst::invalid_utf8`. The plate is
the one file a refused path cannot merely skip: the world loads it at its
declared path, and any stand-in name may belong to a file the quill holds.

## Validation message contract

Field-level validation diagnostics (`validation::type_mismatch`) emit a single
canonical shape:

- **Field path**: the document-model anchor of the offending field
  (`recipient`, `cards.indorsement[2].author`); see [Document-model
  paths](#document-model-paths).
- **Source token**: the YAML scalar that triggered the error, rendered
  verbatim in its YAML-canonical form (`42`, `null`, `true`, `""`). Strings
  appear quoted; primitives appear bare.
- **Schema declaration**: the field's declared type and, when present,
  its default. Defaults render with the same verbatim formatting.
- **Both exits when applicable**: the message names two ways out. The
  parser does not silently coerce; the message is the lever.

Example messages:

```
Field `build_number` got integer `42`, schema declares `string`.
Either quote the value (`build_number: "42"`) or change the schema's
`type:` to `integer`.
```

A present-null value (`subtitle:`, `subtitle: null`, `subtitle: ~`) is treated
exactly like an omitted field: null ≡ absent, it coerces and validates clean,
and it blank-fills at render (authored › `default:` › blank). A document that
answers nothing therefore produces no field-level diagnostic at all.

Implementation: `crates/core/src/quill/validation.rs` (the `ValidationError`
`Display` impl).

## Document-model paths

`Diagnostic.path` is a **document-model** anchor into a typed `Document`:
one canonical grammar, one serializer, one parser: `DocPath`
(`crates/core/src/path.rs`). Every emit site constructs a `DocPath`; no site
assembles a path with `format!`, so the engine never ships two shapes for one
anchor.

| Anchor | Path |
|---|---|
| Main-card field | `main.recipient` |
| Nested in an array of objects | `main.recipients[0].name` |
| Main body | `main.body` |
| Typed card (whole) | `cards.indorsement[0]` |
| Field on a typed card | `cards.indorsement[0].signature_block` |
| Body on a typed card | `cards.indorsement[0].body` |
| Card of a kind the quill does not declare | `cards[0]` |

Every path is **rooted**: a main field at `main.<field>`, a card field
kind-qualified at `cards.<kind>[<index>].<field>` (kind and document-array index
fused so a consumer gets both without a second lookup). A card of an undeclared
kind has no declared kind to qualify with, so `cards[<index>]`, and every field path
under it, is the only bare-index form. Rooting keeps the
grammar total against a field named for a root (`main.cards`, `main.main`); only
a field literally named `body` still collides with the body terminal. Field
names and card kinds exclude `.`, `[`, `]`, so the rendered form round-trips;
the WASM build exports `parseDocPath` / `formatDocPath` (structured
`DocPathSeg[]` ↔ string) so a consumer routes on segments instead of regexing
the string.

The boundary **mints** as well as parses: `doc.pathFor(addr)` / `doc.cardPath(i)` render a write address as its path, so a consumer holding an `Addr` never restates the kind lookup a card root needs. A wrong-kind path is compared as a string and matches nothing, silently. The mint is quill-free, reading the card's stored `$kind` verbatim: the rule the mutator anchors and the geometry translation use, not `validate`'s declared-kind filter. That filter is the one edge where a minted path and a validation diagnostic differ for the same card.

`DocPath` is the anchor on **every** address that crosses to a consumer, not
only `Diagnostic.path`. Mutator (`edit::*`) diagnostics carry it (a field error
at `main.<field>` or `cards.<kind>[<i>].<field>`, a structural out-of-range op at
`cards[<i>]`), `set_all`'s batch keying on a field name under one card's base;
and `LiveSession` geometry (`regions` / `fieldAt` / `positionAt` / `locate`)
keys on it: the session translates the backend's plate-space form to `DocPath`
at the boundary, segment by segment — the `$cards.<kind>.<ordinal>` head to the
absolute index, a numeric tail segment to a bracketed array index
(`references.0` → `main.references[0]`) — so one parser routes diagnostics and
geometry alike, and a geometry address and the validation diagnostic on the
same place are the same string.

**Three grammars, one that crosses.** Only `DocPath` reaches a consumer. The
other two stay backend/template-internal and are named here so they are not
confused with it:

- **Plate JSON**: the sigiled `data.$cards` a template author composes
  ([CARDS.md](CARDS.md)), and the plate-space geometry address a plate's `$path`
  mints: a `.`-separated run under an optional `$cards.<kind>.<ordinal>` head,
  where an all-digit segment is an array index (`references.0`) and `$body` the
  body terminal. A template-author contract (`form-field(field: "refs.2")`,
  `display(..)`, every published `form.json`), so it keeps its own spelling
  (renaming it is a blast radius) and translates to `DocPath` before it crosses.
- **Schema-space coercion anchors**: `CoercionError` keeps its own
  `card_kinds.<kind>.<field>` / bare-field anchors, a schema-declaration
  namespace, not a document path. Where a coercion becomes an
  `edit::field_coercion_failed`, the binding re-anchors it in `DocPath` space at the
  field being written; the raw schema-space anchor does not cross.

Config-space anchors (`$seed.<kind>.<field>`, Quill.yaml schema-literal owner
labels) ride the `DocPath` serializer with their prefix as a leading segment.

## Diagnostic args

`message` is the canonical English rendering. `args` is what it interpolates, keyed by name, so a consumer with its own string table selects a sentence by `code` and fills it itself. `code` + `args` is the substitution unit; `code` + `message` is not.

Values keep their JSON shape (`allowed` arrives as a list, `len` as a number) because joining and pluralizing are locale decisions, not the engine's.

**Engine prose never rides under a key.** Where a message bottoms out in text minted per-site (`CoercionError`'s `reason`, the ~20 `parse::invalid_structure` sites, another codec's error), that text stays in `message` and contributes no arg. A consumer's own sentence is then coarser than ours (`edit::field_coercion_failed` says which field and which target type, not which of a dozen ways the value failed to become one). That is the contract, not a gap in it: a coarser sentence a consumer owns beats a fluent one half in the wrong language. The full-fidelity alternative (a key holding English) is worse than omission, because the fallback below cannot fire on a key that is present.

**Falling back is wholesale.** A formatter whose template needs a key that is absent renders `message`, never a sentence with a hole in it. It takes `hint` from the engine in the same breath: the hint is the same English as the message tail (`ValidationError`'s `Display` appends it verbatim), so translating one and passing the other through ships a two-language diagnostic. Localize a code and you own both sentences; fall back and you take both.

**`hint` needs no code of its own.** It is a function of `code` and `args`. Most hints are per-code constants. `type_mismatch_hint` branches only on whether a default exists, which is why `default` is present as a key exactly when the schema declares one, rather than present-and-null; the two card-kind hints branch only on whether `allowed` is empty; the `not_inline` sentences branch only on `trailingNewline`, present exactly when a `plaintext` value is one line plus the newline a clip-chomped `|` keeps. Any datum a hint branches on is message-relevant by definition and belongs in `args`; a parallel `hint_code` would be derived state on the wire, free to drift.

**Anchors do not travel twice.** `path` is never an arg. `field` and `kind` are, even though `doc_path` also folds them into the anchor; the rule bars the assembled path string, and recovering a name from one is unsound anyway, since `DocPath` renders field segments unescaped and parses on `.` and `[`, so exactly the malformed names `edit::invalid_field_name` reports can round-trip into different segments. `CoercionError`'s `path` stays out for the separate reason below in § "Three grammars": it is a schema-space anchor and does not cross.

**Growth is additive.** Per code, keys are append-only and never retyped, and value spellings are as frozen as the keys: `sourceToken`'s verbatim-YAML form (`42`, `null`, `""`), `actual`'s `integer`-vs-`number` vocabulary. Codes themselves are governed the same way, which is what makes them safe to key a string table on. Without that, an upgrade turns into a silent English regression in every localized consumer.

### Coverage

The table is the contract, so it is tested like one: `diagnostic_args_match_canon` in `crates/core/src/error.rs` fails if code and canon disagree, and its twin asserts the codes off the table carry nothing. Each `args()` binds every field rather than eliding with `..`, so a new field on a variant does not compile until it decides whether it is message-relevant.

That pair holds code and table together and cannot hold either still: a rename edits both in one commit and passes. The keys a consumer outside this repository reads are pinned separately, by `args_keys_a_named_consumer_reads` beside them — a list that does not move when the table does, so renaming one of those keys fails here rather than downstream, a release later.

Three outcomes, and the wire tells them apart only with this table in hand, since "no keys" reads identically for the second and third:

- **structured**: keys present; the consumer writes the whole sentence.
- **code-determined**: no keys needed; the sentence follows from `code` and the anchor alone. Fully localizable.
- **fallback**: render `message`.

`parse::missing_quill` looks code-determined and is not: it picks one of three sentences by re-reading the source, and no field records which.

Every `conform::*` row is reachable only through the content-field walk, so the family is narrower than its `edit::*` twin. `conform::field_coercion_failed` fires for a scalar nested inside a content-bearing field: an `array` of `richtext`, an `object` with a `richtext` property. A top-level scalar never reaches it: it surfaces as `validation::format_violation` or `validation::type_mismatch` where the render floor refuses it too, and nowhere where the floor adopts it.

### Scope

`validation::*`, `edit::*`, and `parse::*` are the codes an end user meets, and the table covers them. The rest carry no args, which is the domain's shape rather than a phase of the work:

- **`quill::*`** is quill-authoring. Its reader is a template author debugging `Quill.yaml`, the one audience for whom canonical English is the deliverable. Three of its codes are `format!`-built per slot besides.
- **`typst::*`** is a closed set (`error_mapping.rs`), but a coarse one: the compile codes classify a Typst diagnostic without taking it apart, so the detail stays in the message that carries it.

Because those codes carry no args, every consumer template falls back on them by the rule above. That is what makes a surface covering a third of the codes total rather than partial.

## Error Presentation

**Pretty printing** (`Diagnostic::fmt_pretty()`):
```
[ERROR] Undefined variable (E001)
  --> template.typ:10:5
  hint: Check variable spelling
```

One printer, reached from every surface: the CLI, Python's `str(diagnostic)`, and WASM's `formatDiagnostic(d)`. A consumer surfacing the engine's English calls it rather than holding a copy of the layout. A consumer wording its own selects by `code` + `args` (§ "Diagnostic args") and owns the layout with the sentence.

**Consolidated printing**: the CLI pretty-prints every diagnostic a `RenderError` carries, one per line, to stderr.

**Machine-readable**: all diagnostic types implement `serde::Serialize`.
