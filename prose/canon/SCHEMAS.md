# Schema Model (`QuillConfig`)

> **Implementation**: `crates/core/src/quill/`

## TL;DR

`QuillConfig` is the only schema model in quillmark. Validation, coercion, defaults extraction, and public schema emission all read directly from it.

## Quill.yaml DSL

Schema authoring lives in `Quill.yaml` under:

- `main.fields`
- `card_kinds.<card_name>.fields`
- optional `ui` and `body` blocks on `main` and each card kind

Supported field types:

| Quill.yaml Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `string` | Open scalar UTF-8 text: a value the template computes with (URL, path, identifier, reference key), not prose it lays out |
| `enum` | Closed string domain of **choices**; requires a `values:` list. Also accepts its blank (`""`), which is never a declared member — declaring one is a load error (`quill::enum_blank_member`). Projects to JSON-Schema `{type: string, enum: ["", …]}`. `values:` on any other type, and `enum:` on any type at all, is a load error |
| `number` | Numeric value (integers and decimals) |
| `integer` | Integer-only numeric value |
| `boolean` | `true` / `false` |
| `array` | Ordered list; requires an `items:` element schema (e.g. `items: { type: string }` for `string[]`, `items: { type: object, properties: … }` for a typed table) |
| `object` | Structured map; requires `properties:` |
| `date` | A strict calendar date `YYYY-MM-DD`. Rejects any time component (a time-bearing string is a `datetime`, not a truncated date). The common case in a document engine, so it is the unmarked date type. Stored verbatim; lowers to a native Typst `datetime(year:, month:, day:)`, with `display(<addr>, ..)` for a click-to-edit rendering (see `PLATE_DATA.md`) |
| `datetime` | A strict offset-less wall-clock datetime `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm[:ss]`, seconds optional (zero-filled). Rejects timezone offsets (`Z`, `±HH:MM`), the space separator, fractional seconds, and a bare date (which is a `date`). An offset is **rejected, never dropped**: the engine does no zone math, keeping wall-clock semantics end to end. Stored verbatim; lowers the same way over the six-component `datetime(year:, .., second:)` |
| `plaintext` | Navigable **unformatted** prose over the same canonical content (`Content`) as `richtext` (same media type, nav, and regions) but a **literal** codec (`from_plaintext`/`to_plaintext`): delimiters stay literal, no markup, verbatim round-trip. Declare `inline: true` for the single-line variant. Constrained mark-/island-free (`Content::is_plain`); a formatted wire content is rejected (`validation::not_plain`), not stripped. **Rests as the literal string** — in the *document*. A plate receives the content object, exactly as for `richtext` (no backend reads the `plaintext` annotation): there is deliberately no plate-side content→`str` projection, since no plate has needed one |
| `richtext` | Rich **formatted** prose over a canonical content (`Content`); markdown is a projection of it. Declare `inline: true` for the single-line variant (exactly one `Para` line, no container, no islands). The pre-richtext `markdown` spelling and the retired `type: richtext(inline)` token are schema load errors (`quill::field_parse_error`). **Rests as the canonical content object** |

### Enum variants

An `enum` may declare `variants:`, a per-member field set that exists only in the
world where the discriminant holds that member:

```yaml
classification:
  type: enum
  values: [UNCLASSIFIED, CUI, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET]
  variants:
    CUI:
      controlled_by: { type: string }
      poc:           { type: string }
      category:      { type: string, default: "" }
```

`variants:` is the one key that changes a field's **resting shape**: the field
rests as `{value: <member>, …the member's fields}` at every projection, where a
variantless enum rests as a bare string. A document authors it as the container,
and the bare scalar (`classification: CUI`) is accepted as the spelling of a
world carrying no variant answers — coercion normalizes both, so one shape
reaches every surface downstream. `value` is reserved
(`quill::variant_reserved_field_name`): it names the discriminant.

This is the DSL's only cross-field shape, and it buys three things the flat map
could not say:

- **Existence.** A `cui_`-style name prefix is hand-written namespacing that only
  prose can scope. Nesting supplies the namespace structurally, and the names
  shorten to what they mean.
- **Obligation, conditionally.** `must_fill` inside a variant keeps its ordinary
  `default:`-presence derivation, so it reads *"required in this world"*: `poc`
  is obliged on a CUI memo and silent on every other one. This is the one
  cross-field constraint the engine checks rather than describes.
- **A UI signal.** `variants:` is keyed by member on the declaration view
  ([`Quill::schema`](#schema-emission)), so an editor shows and retires
  cells as the discriminant changes instead of hard-coding the rule.

**The wire carries exactly the live world, and totality is per-world.** The
render floor emits `value` plus the selected member's fields — blank-filled as
usual — and nothing else: the container is a *closed* shape, so a payload never
reaches a plate under a tag that disowns it. A plate is already obliged to branch
over `values ∪ blank` ([Blank-filled render](#blank-filled-render)); inside that
branch every declared field of that world is present, so the access needs no
guard, and outside it there is nothing to guard. The blank owns no field set, so
an unanswered discriminant renders `{value: ""}` and the empty-document contract
is untouched.

**A stranded value is carried, not dropped.** An authored cell whose variant is
out of play stays in the document and draws the non-fatal
`validation::out_of_variant`; the render floor omits it. Dropping it at coercion
would spend the author's answers on the ordinary editor gesture — choose CUI,
fill the block, flip to UNCLASSIFIED to compare, flip back — and gating render
would hand them an undraftable document. Only the wire is strict.

The ceiling is deliberate and enforced at load rather than discovered at render:

| Rule | Code |
|---|---|
| `variants:` on a non-enum field | `quill::variants_on_non_enum` |
| a key outside `values:` (the blank owns no variant) | `quill::variant_unknown_value` |
| `variants:` below card level, or inside another variant | `quill::variant_placement` |
| an empty `variants:` map, or an empty variant | `quill::variant_empty` |
| a variant field named `value` | `quill::variant_reserved_field_name` |
| a name two variants declare *differently* | `quill::variant_field_collision` |

A variant carries any **leaf** type a card field may, prose and dates included. Every surface reaches a cell through the same dispatcher a card field uses — coercion through `conform_value`, validation through `validate_value`, the render floor through `resolve_value`, lowering through the schema-node walk ([PLATE_DATA.md](PLATE_DATA.md)) — so a `richtext` or `date` cell behaves as a card-level one does.

Variant fields are leaves exactly as an object's properties are: no container one level down, and no `ui.group` (they inherit the discriminant's).

Two limits follow from the container shape and are accepted, not worked around:
[`resolve()`](#the-resolved-value-view-resolve) reports **one** rung for the whole
container, as it does for a typed dictionary; and a field set **shared** across
several members is spelled by repeating it or sharing a YAML anchor, since a
variant keys on one member.

A cell is addressable one step down, exactly as a typed dictionary's property is
([PLATE_DATA.md](PLATE_DATA.md#schema-addresses)): `classification.poc` binds a
`form-field` widget or a `field-region` claim on either backend, and
`classification.value` the discriminant. Addressing is against the *schema*, so a
cell is bindable in every world — a form is built once and the document selects
its world later. The whole container is not bindable: its value is the container
object, which no widget coerces.

A repeated name is one **cell** of the container, not one per world: the coercion
lookup and the transform schema both key on the name alone, never the
discriminant. So every variant declaring a name must declare it identically —
`quill::variant_field_collision` rejects disagreement at load, rather than letting
a live value coerce under another world's type.

The text-ish types form a **data vs content** × **open/plain vs closed/formatted**
2×2: `enum` (closed data), `string` (open data), `plaintext` (plain content),
`richtext` (formatted content). Navigation/regions are a property of the content
model, so `plaintext` and `richtext` share the entire nav/region/preview
stack and the same backend lowering (both carry `contentMediaType:
application/quillmark-content+json`); `plaintext` additionally carries
`quillmark:plain: true`, an editor-only annotation backends ignore.

### Content fields rest per codec

A content field's **resting form** is the shape it is stored in once anything
schema-aware has written it: the typed writer, the seeder, or `Quill::conform`
(the bound door, [BINDINGS.md](BINDINGS.md)). It is per-codec, and the split is
forced, not chosen:

| Codec | Rest | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `richtext` | the canonical content object | the markdown projection is lossy (anchors, island ids, content-only marks), so string rest loses identity |
| `plaintext` | the literal string | `from_plaintext`/`to_plaintext` are inverses on plain content and `is_plain` excludes every mark, so string rest loses nothing, while object rest corrupts at emit |

Emit is schema-free: `project_content_field` routes every canonical content
object it finds through `export::to_markdown`, and it cannot sniff the codec
from the shape (a `richtext` content that happens to be plain is
indistinguishable from a `plaintext` one). An object-rest `plaintext` field
holding `a *literal* line` would therefore emit markdown-escaped
(`a \*literal\* line`), and a re-parse would read the backslashes as
characters. String rest removes that; the plate is unaffected, since the render
floor still coerces `plaintext` to the content object backends receive
([PLATE_DATA.md](PLATE_DATA.md)).

Rest is enforced only for a **declared content field**: one whose type tree
bears a content leaf (`field_contains_content`), and its whole subtree conforms
with it. Non-content-typed fields keep their authored shorthands; the typed
write remains their canonicalizer.

**A content leaf is readable at its codec wherever it sits in that subtree, not
only when the field itself is one.** `reader.get_content(name)` answers for a
whole-field leaf; `reader.get_content_at(name, path)` walks the same `items` /
`properties` axis conform walks, reaching an `array<richtext>` element, an
`object`'s content property, or a leaf under both. Without it the caller reads
the stored element and decides for itself what the bytes mean, which is the
judgement the resting form exists to remove. The caller also has less to decide
with: the codec is a schema fact, and the stored shape does not carry it.

### A declared type change rewrites stored values

Changing a field's declared type reinterprets every stored value in that field at the next bound load: `Quill::conform` derives rest from the current schema and value, holding no record of the type a value was written under, so the reinterpretation is unconditional and carries no diagnostic.

The mechanism is deliberate. A type change migrates a deployed corpus with no migration script, and read-repair is the documented convergence path ([DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md](DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md) § "Byte-stability").

Scalar → content is the lossy direction: the stored string enters the codec's import, markup delimiters are consumed as structure, and the authored text is not recoverable. A `subject` holding `Cost * Benefit Analysis *DRAFT*` rests verbatim under `string`; under `richtext` it rests as content whose text is `Cost * Benefit Analysis DRAFT` carrying an emph mark, the literal asterisks gone.

**A declared type change is therefore a new quill version**, the rule [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) § "Ref Immutability" states for any content behind a canonical ref. Nothing enforces it: `check_quill_reference` compares the document's `$quill` name and selector against the loaded quill, and an in-place schema edit at the same version leaves both matching, so a document pinned to `name@0.2.0` conforms against a schema it was never authored under and the mismatch is unrepresentable.

## Type coercion

`QuillConfig::coerce_payload` and `coerce_card` run before validation.

- Returns `Result<IndexMap<String, QuillValue>, CoercionError>`
- Coerces top-level fields and per-card fields to their declared types
- Fails fast (`Err`) on the first value that cannot be coerced
Coercion rules per type:

| Type | Rule |
|---|---|
| `array` | array wrapping plus element-wise coercion against the `items` schema; a bad element fails at its indexed path, e.g. `counts[1]` |
| `boolean` | from string, int, or float |
| `number` / `integer` | from string, or from boolean (`true→1`, `false→0`) |
| `string` | unwraps a length-1 string array into the bare string; identity otherwise |
| `richtext` | commits the canonical content form (the model): an authored markdown string imports via `quillmark-content::import`, an editor-supplied content object revalidates and re-canonicalizes. The length-1-array-unwrap and bare-scalar-stringify leniencies feed the import |
| `date` / `datetime` | per-type strict-grammar validation, stored verbatim: a `date` rejects any time component, a `datetime` rejects offsets/space/fractional/bare-date. Neither truncates |
| `object` | property recursion |
- **`inline` richtext enforcement.** A `richtext` field with `inline: true`
  requires its content to be exactly one `Para` line, in no container, with no
  islands (`Content::is_inline`). The empty content satisfies it, so a blank or
  blank-filled inline field passes. The constraint is checked in three places:
  coercion (`CoercionError` for a document value), validation
  (`validation::not_inline`, the `TypeMismatch` fatality class, as a backstop for a
  content that bypassed coercion), and load-time example import (a schema literal
  that violates it is a load error). Blueprint still annotates inline fields as
  `richtext(inline)<markdown>`; `build_transform_schema` emits
  `quillmark:inline: true`
- **`plaintext` coercion and enforcement.** A `plaintext` value rides the same
  content as `richtext`, differing only at the codec:
  - a string imports through the **literal** codec (`from_plaintext`,
    verbatim: no markdown parse, no escaping);
  - an editor-supplied content object is validated **plain**
    (`Content::is_plain`: no marks, no islands, all `Para` lines) rather than
    markdown-decoded. A formatted wire content is rejected, not stripped.

  Enforcement mirrors the `inline` precedent, in the same three places:
  coercion (`CoercionError`); validation (`validation::not_plain`, the
  `TypeMismatch` fatality class); load-time literal import. An `inline: true`
  plaintext field additionally requires a single line. The load-time content
  caches (`default_content`/`example_content`) and the render-floor blank (the
  empty content) cover `plaintext` exactly as `richtext`: both are content
  leaves (`field_contains_content`)
- **`enum` domain validation.** An `enum` field coerces as a string; domain membership is a *value* check (`validation::enum_violation`), not a type check, so an out-of-domain string is well-typed but invalid. `type: enum` requires a non-empty `values:` list; `values:` on any other type is a load error (`quill::field_parse_error`), as is `enum:` on any type. The domain rides one carrier (`FieldSchema::enum_values`), and every consumer keys on that carrier rather than on the `Enum` token: the render floor, the pdfform widget kind, the blueprint annotation, and the transform-schema projection to `{type: string, enum: […]}`
- **Null short-circuits coercion.** A null value (`field:`, `field: null`,
  `field: ~`) passes coercion unchanged for *every* type: null ≡ absent, so
  it carries no data to coerce. The value reaches the render floor and
  blank-fills (authored › `default:` › blank) exactly like an omitted
  field
- **Bare scalars stringify into `string`/`richtext` fields.** A bare boolean,
  integer, or number written where a `string` is expected adopts its canonical
  scalar token (`true`, `47`, `1.0`) instead of failing: it is unambiguously
  text (null and collections are excluded); a `richtext` field then imports that
  token as its markdown source. The leniency is scoped to
  *document* payloads via the shared `scalar_as_string` predicate; a quill
  author's own `default:`/`example:` literals stay strict, so the blueprint
  keeps quoting ambiguous string literals

## Native validation

Validation is implemented by a native walker over `QuillConfig` in `quill/validation.rs`.

- Entry point: `QuillConfig::validate_document(&Document)` (dispatches to `validate_typed_document`)
- Returns `Result<(), Vec<ValidationError>>`
- Collects all errors (does not short-circuit)
- Emits path-aware errors for top-level fields and card fields
- Validates each card's `$kind` matches a known card kind
- Enforces `body.enabled: false` on the main card and on each card kind: body content for a body-disabled card emits `ValidationError::BodyDisabled` (whitespace-only bodies are treated as empty)
- `body.enabled: false` also drops `$body` from `build_transform_schema`'s `properties` for that kind: absent, not present-and-empty. This cascades into the Typst helper's generated `_qm-meta` address tables, so `form-field(field:)` rejects a `$body` address on that kind at compile time (see `PLATE_DATA.md`)
- **Null ≡ absent.** A present-null value (`field:`, `field: null`,
  `field: ~`) carries no data: it is treated exactly like an omitted field.
  It validates clean (no `TypeMismatch`) and blank-fills at render
  (authored › `default:` › blank; see
  [Blank-filled render](#blank-filled-render)).
- **Null ≡ absent is a 1.0 commitment, not a stopgap.** The identification is
  chosen and final: `field: null` and an omitted field are one state,
  indistinguishable by design. The consequences are accepted, not worked
  around: "explicitly cleared" and "never touched" cannot be told apart, so
  there is no uniform "blank, not default" for a non-string type, and
  `removeField` (drop the key) stays the sole unset verb; a present-null
  carries no distinct "cleared" signal. The tri-state alternative (absent /
  null / value) is foreclosed: it doubles every field's state space for one
  rarely-authored distinction, breaks YAML round-trip sanity (a loaded-then-
  saved document must not sprout `field: null` lines), and buys nothing the
  ladder does not already give. The simpler model is the contract.
- **Null ≡ absent holds on the value ladder; the obligation surface splits
  them.** The identification above is about *values*, and it stays unqualified:
  null and absent blank-fill identically. `must_fill` asks a different question
  — did a human make a call — and writing the field's blank is one while
  clearing the key is not, so `field: ""` discharges the warning and
  `field: null` does not. Two verbs therefore part company: `removeField` and
  writing the blank are one act on the value ladder and two here, and a UI
  rendering both as an empty box shows nothing of the difference. That is the
  price of letting a human answer "deliberately nothing" at all: keying the
  obligation on the resolved source rung instead would leave the deliberate
  blank unspellable and go blind to a must-fill leaf inside a touched container.
- **`validation::must_fill` → non-fatal warning, from two triggers.**
  `Quill::validate` emits it at **`Severity::Warning`** when either holds, with a
  `trigger` arg naming which:
  - `marker` — a `!must_fill` marker is present (root or nested, main card or
    composable card), whether or not it carries a value. The marker is
    document-sovereign: it fires without consulting the schema, and a human
    dropping it is a decision nothing re-derives.
  - `unauthored` — the schema obliges the cell and the document leaves it
    absent or present-null.

  Neither subsumes the other. A hand-written or programmatically built document
  carries no marker; a seeded `example` is present, in-domain, and structurally
  indistinguishable from authored content. Where both would fire on one path
  (a bare marker on an unauthored cell) one diagnostic is emitted and the marker
  wins: its hint is the actionable one. It **never gates render**: the cell
  blank-fills, or uses its suggested value. A strict consumer (e.g. an LLM
  authoring loop) treats any outstanding warning as "not done."
- **Absence semantics**: a missing (or present-null) field with a `default:`
  accepts the default; without a `default:` it blank-fills. Either way it
  coerces and validates clean — absence is never *malformed*, and there is no
  `field_absent` code. On the editor surface it is surfaced where the schema
  obliges it: an unauthored must-fill cell warns. So `Quill::validate` on an
  incomplete document is not clean, and the count is per *document* — a card
  kind obliges nothing until an instance of it exists.

Field-level type and presence errors render under a uniform shape:
field path, verbatim source token, schema declaration, and both exits
when applicable. See `ERROR.md` § "Validation message contract".

## Value sources and projections

Every field value comes from one of a small set of **sources**, ordered by
*commitment*: how strongly the value claims to be the real answer. This is the
**commitment ladder**:

| Rung | Source | Persisted into a `Document`? | Renders? |
|---|---|---|---|
| top | authored value | yes: it *is* the document content | yes |
| | `default:` | **never** by the engine: lives in the schema, interpolated only into the ephemeral render projection | yes: the fidelity value |
| | `example:` | only by [seeding](#document-seeding) | yes: once committed by seeding |
| floor | the field's `blank` (`blank`) | never ([Non-persist invariant](#blank-filled-render)) | last resort |
| (signal) | `!must_fill` marker | yes: rides on the value as a YAML tag | yes: the marked value (suggested value or blank-fill); raises the non-fatal `validation::must_fill` warning |

A `default` is never written back into a document: it lives in `Quill.yaml`,
the render path interpolates it into the plate-JSON projection only, and seeding
deliberately omits it (persisting it would be redundant and would freeze it
against a schema change). The lone way a default's *value* becomes document
content is indirect: `blueprint()` emits it as literal text in its reference
*string* (the concrete default value, shippable as-is), and if a consumer authors from it and saves
it, that value is now ordinary **authored** content: the consumer committed
it, not the engine.

No surface owns a precedence *policy*; each **projection cuts the same ladder**
at a different rung, and the per-rung producers are shared (`blank` for the
floor; field ordering is declaration order, carried by the schema's ordered
field maps rather than a sort key):

| Projection | Per-field precedence | Floor | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| render (fidelity) | authored › `default:` › blank | blank | plate JSON: [Blank-filled render](#blank-filled-render) |
| `blueprint` document | value: `default:` › `example:` › blank; marker: the derived `must_fill` | blank (under the marker) | annotated string, [BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md) |
| seeding | `example:` › absent, stamped `!must_fill` where the schema obliges | (deferred to render floor) | committed `Document`: [Document seeding](#document-seeding) |
| add-card (into a document) | `$seed` overlay › `example:` › absent | (deferred to render floor) | a new composable `Card`: [Document seeding](#document-seeding) |
| editor (consumer-side) | authored › `default:` › blank, resolved per field and **tagged with its source rung** | blank | the engine's [`resolve()`](#the-resolved-value-view-resolve) resolved-value view: value and source rung per field |

The consumer-side `Document`-payload × schema join is a **non-goal**:
[`resolve()`](#the-resolved-value-view-resolve) supersedes it. The
editor reads value and source rung from one engine call rather than re-cutting
the ladder in consumer code. Completeness and errors stay `Quill::validate`'s
(a consumer merges it with its own diagnostic producers regardless), and schema
guidance (`example:`, labels, groups) reads from `Quill::schema`.

Two seams are deliberate, not uniform: on `blueprint` the floor still
blank-fills like every other projection (a must-fill cell with no `example`
carries bare null/empty under its marker), but the projection additionally
**stamps the `!must_fill` marker** on every must-fill field: the marker
rides *alongside* the value rather than replacing it; and `blank` is a property
of the field rather than a member of the type's domain — an `enum`'s blank is
`""`, outside `values:`
(there is no empty enum member). Both are detailed below.

### The resolved-value view (`resolve()`)

`Quill::resolve(doc)` (WASM `resolve`) cuts the render ladder into
observable data: for every declared field, the value `compile_data` would emit
into the plate, tagged with its source rung (`authored` / `default` / `blank`):
byte-for-byte with the plate on every fixture. The shape is nested: a `main`
card and a `cards` list, each card's `fields` an ordered array of `{ name,
value, source }` rows in declaration order: order is structural, not object-key
order. The card body is a `body` sibling on the card, not a row in `fields`:
present iff the kind enables a body (`enabled: false` undeclares it, so `body` is
`null`), its source only ever `authored` (non-blank) or `blank` (blank).
Source is one **top-level** rung per field; a nested blank-fill inside an authored
dict or array is a projection detail of the value, not a per-subpath source.

Value and provenance only. The view carries no diagnostics: completeness and
errors stay `Quill::validate`'s, which a consumer merges with its own producers
(session warnings, render errors) regardless, so bucketing here would delete no
consumer code. Schema guidance (`example:`, labels, groups) reads from
`Quill::schema`. Python is out of scope until a Python consumer names a call
site (the Tier-1 cut, [BINDINGS.md](BINDINGS.md)).

## Blank-filled render

**A document need not be complete to render**: render success is not a
completeness signal. Shippability is the author's judgment; the engine's only
hard requirement is that the document be *well-formed* (values coerce). A
`!must_fill` marker and a present-null cell are both renderable, and neither
surfaces as a diagnostic beyond the non-fatal `validation::must_fill` warning
(see [Native validation](#native-validation)).

Rendering and the *completeness verdict* are orthogonal. The render path
(`QuillConfig::compile_data` and the ladder it cuts, `ladder_sourced`, both in
core's `quill::compose`; the engine calls it) uses **blank-filled render**:
every absent schema field is resolved by precedence: an authored value, else
the `default:`, else the field's blank (`blank`, defined below): in the
plate-JSON projection that feeds the backend **only, never in the persisted
document**.

- **Incomplete is renderable.** A document that merely omits a field (or
  leaves it present-null) renders fine: the field is blank-filled in the
  projection, and coercion/validation pass. A must-fill field it leaves
  unauthored warns on the editor surface and still renders.
- **Malformed is fatal.** The only malformed case is a value that cannot
  coerce to (or validate against) its declared type. Placeholders and null
  are *not* malformed: a `!must_fill` marker renders, using its suggested
  value or blank-filling, and a present-null cell blank-fills like an absent
  field.
- **Non-persist invariant.** The blank-fill lives only in the ephemeral
  projection and must never be written back. A blank is
  indistinguishable from authored-empty, so persisting it would erase the
  absence signal (which keys on a field being unwritten) and blind a future
  schema migration to author intent.

**A field's blank is a property of the field, not a member of the type's value
domain.** It is both the render floor and the value a reader recognizes as
"nobody said anything":

| Type | Blank |
|---|---|
| `string`, `date`, `datetime` | `""` (a date's `""` lowers to Typst `none`) |
| `enum` | `""` — reserved, and never a member of `values:` |
| `richtext`, `plaintext` | the empty content |
| `array` | `[]` |
| `object` | every property at its own blank, recursively |
| `integer`, `number` | `0` |
| `boolean` | `false` |
| `enum` with `variants:` | `{value: ""}` — the container holding the blank |

Nothing forces an enum's blank to sit inside `values:`, and putting it there
destroys it: the floor would return a real choice nobody made, and a cosmetic
`values:` reorder would change what an unanswered document renders. So
**`values:` is for choices; the blank is for the absence of one**, and a quill
declaring `""` in `values:` fails to load (`quill::enum_blank_member`). Where
the empty state is itself a decision the document should record, it is a member
— `undecided`, `waived`, `n_a` — not the blank.

The accepted domain is therefore `values ∪ blank` everywhere a value is checked
or projected, at element position inside an `array` as well as at the top level.
The two projections differ deliberately: `Quill::schema` is the *declaration*
view and emits `values:` verbatim (injecting the blank would emit a schema that
fails to load), while the transform schema is the *wire* contract and emits
`enum: ["", …values]`, so a standard JSON-Schema validator accepts what the
engine accepts. A consumer's picker offers the blank as a real, re-selectable
option labelled by `ui.blank_title` — never a vanishing placeholder, because
returning to it is how a human clears a cell back to unset.

**The table has a permanent seam at `integer`, `number` and `boolean`**, and any
`object` or `array` over them, since their blank is the recursive one: `0` and
`false` are indistinguishable at the plate from an authored `0` and `false`. A
wire `none` for those types would be type-*absent* rather than type-*minimal*,
and Typst arithmetic and comparison reject it, which would cost the totality the
floor exists to buy. An author needing to spell "unset" for a number models it
as an `enum`, which has a real blank — at the cost of forfeiting arithmetic.

`blank` is the shared producer behind the render floor: for authored, blank, and
seeded documents alike (see [BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md)).

**A plate must branch exhaustively over `values ∪ blank`.** The blank is valid
present input, so an `else` fallback re-opens exactly the fabrication the blank
closes: the cell renders a variant nobody chose, and the plate cannot tell the
two apart. This is a retrofit obligation on existing plates, not only guidance
for new ones. Where the enum declares `variants:` the obligation also earns
something: the branch is what makes the world's fields readable without a guard
(see [Enum variants](#enum-variants)).

## Document seeding

**Seeding** builds a starter `Document` from the schema for editor consumers
("new document"): each field that declares an `example:` is committed, and
**every other field is left absent**. The seeding cascade is therefore
`example: → absent`: absent fields are never written; they are interpolated at
the compilation layer by [blank-filled render](#blank-filled-render) (`default:`,
else the field's blank), exactly as for any authored document.

**Seed-commits-rest.** A seeded content field commits its codec's resting form
(a richtext field and the body the canonical content, a plaintext field its
literal string), so a seeded document is at rest from birth: `conform` of a
seed is a byte no-op, and a seed → store → load → conform cycle cannot move a
hash on a document nobody edited. The commit runs through the same strict write
the typed writer uses, overlay values included, which is what makes the seeder
and the bound door agree rather than merely coincide. The content is imported
once at quill load into a
`#[serde(skip)]` companion cache on the schema (`FieldSchema::default_content` /
`example_content`, `BodyCardSchema::example_content`), a pure function of the
`Quill.yaml` bytes; seeding and the render floor read that cache rather than
re-importing markdown per document. The cache is the *content* either way, since
the render floor injects `default_content` into the plate uncoerced; only the
seed's commit takes the extra step to the field's rest. The authored markdown literal is retained
untouched: it is the source of truth the schema emits and the blueprint prints;
the content is a derived projection of it.

The load pass walks the **schema**, not the card's field map, so a leaf's companions are populated wherever it is declared — an object property, a typed table's row property, a variant cell. A leaf's `default:` is its own, and the render floor reads the companion off whichever leaf it resolves, so an unpopulated position blank-fills and drops the author's default silently: covering every one is what makes an absent companion mean "no literal" rather than "not reached". Importing is also checking, so a nested `richtext(inline)` violation is a load error there, in a `default:` or an `example:`.

Committing *only* `example` is the whole design. The render ladder already
produces `default` and the blank at compile time but **never `example`** (example
is excluded from the render path; see [BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md)), so
`example` is the one source the render floor cannot reproduce. Persisting a
`default` would be redundant (the floor interpolates it anyway) and would
*freeze* it against a later schema change; persisting a blank is outright
forbidden ([Non-persist invariant](#blank-filled-render)). So the seed writes
exactly the one source that wouldn't otherwise appear and leaves the rest to
the floor. This keeps a split-screen editor/preview consistent: the document
carries real content, the preview renders it, and absent fields resolve
identically in both panes.

The seed is **illustration-first**: a field carrying *both* an `example` and a
`default` commits (and therefore renders) its **`example`**, not its default.
So a seeded document is *not* the plain fidelity render. The fidelity render
path's "`default:` wins" rule applies to authored and blank documents, where no
`example` is ever present; in a seed the `example` is present, so it wins.

- **Composable cards** are seeded one instance per declared kind; `body.example`
  fills the body when bodies are enabled.
- **The main card** carries `$quill` and `$kind: main`, so a seed round-trips
  through Markdown like an authored document.
- **A seeded `example` on a must-fill field commits carrying its marker.** An
  `example` documents *shape*, so a seeded one is not an answer. Stamping it is
  what makes the blueprint and its filled-out twin stamp the same cells: a fresh
  seed reports incomplete in exactly the cells a hand-written document does. A `$seed` overlay value is exempt — supplying one is a template
  author deciding, which is the act the marker asks for.
- **Provenance is otherwise untracked in the persisted document.** A seeded
  value is committed as ordinary authored content, indistinguishable from
  hand-authored input; whether it came from seeding or later authoring is not
  recorded, and correctness and renderability do not depend on the distinction.
  The marker is not provenance — a human may drop it without changing the value,
  and nothing re-derives it (see [Native validation](#native-validation)). The
  commitment *rung* is a separate axis, reported on read: the
  [`resolve()`](#the-resolved-value-view-resolve) projection tags each
  field `authored` / `default` / `blank`: a seeded and a hand-authored value both
  read as `authored`, both being document content.

Seeding is the **filled-out twin of the blueprint**
([BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md) § "The blueprint and its filled-out twin"): the
blueprint shows the form to fill (`!must_fill` markers, `# e.g.` hints), while the seed
hands back a committed `Document` already carrying the `example:` values, the
rest deferred to the render floor for fidelity. It is the only "filled-out"
projection: there is no annotated `example` string. Implemented by
`Quill::seed_document` (with `seed_main` / `seed_card`) in `quillmark-core`.

### Per-document seed overlays (`$seed`)

Seeding a *new card into an existing document*: `Quill::seed_card(kind,
overlay)`, adds one more rung above `example:`: a curated, per-document
**overlay** read from the main card's `$seed` map. Per field the precedence is
**`$seed` overlay › `example:` › absent** (ordered by field declaration order), and `default`
/ the blank stay deferred to the render floor exactly as everywhere else, so the
"never persist a `default`" invariant holds. The overlay is *sparse*: fields it
omits keep flowing from the schema seed, so it tracks an evolving quill rather
than freezing a snapshot. This is how a template author customizes the values
new cards spawn with; it lives in the document (a template *is* a document), so
markdown writers and MCP agents see the same source. See
[CARDS.md](CARDS.md) "Per-kind Seed Overlays" for the `$seed` mechanics. The
`example: → absent` document-seeding above is the `overlay = None` case (a fresh
document carries no `$seed`).

## Schema emission

`QuillConfig::schema()` returns the structural schema as `serde_json::Value`. It includes:

- Field types, constraints, and `enum`/`default`/`example` annotations
- `ui` hints on fields (`group`, `compact`, `multiline`, `title`) and on cards (`title`, plus the `groups` registry that `group` references). Field display order is not a hint: it is the key order of the emitted `fields`/`properties` maps (declaration order)
- `body` blocks on cards (`enabled`, `example`)

The schema describes only the user-fillable fields. The quill reference
(`name@version`, available from quill metadata) and card-kind
discriminators (the `card_kinds` map keys themselves) are document-level
metadata, not schema fields, and do not appear in `fields`.

`QuillConfig::schema_yaml()` is a YAML wrapper over the same value. The schema is pinned by serde attributes on `FieldSchema`, `CardSchema`, `UiFieldSchema`, `UiCardSchema`, and `BodyCardSchema`: there is no parallel mirror struct.

For LLM/MCP authoring, see [BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md): `blueprint()` emits a document-shaped, pre-filled Markdown reference that's denser than schema for prompt-time use.

Top-level schema keys: `main`, optional `card_kinds` (map keyed by card name).
`main` and each entry in `card_kinds` share the same `CardSchema` shape:
`fields` (map keyed by field name), optional `description`, optional `ui`,
optional `body`. Each `FieldSchema` includes `type`, optional
`description`/`default`/`example`/`enum`/`values`/`variants`/`inline`/`properties`/`items`/`ui`.
The type-gated keys:

- `inline`: valid only on the prose types (`richtext`, `plaintext`).
- `values`: declares an `enum` field's domain, required there.
- `variants`: per-member field sets on an `enum` field, valid only there and only
  at card level (see [Enum variants](#enum-variants)). `schema()` emits it as
  authored, keyed by member; the transform schema instead projects the container,
  flattening every world's fields under `properties` with no member scoping.
- `items`: the element schema, itself a `FieldSchema`; required on `array`
  fields and rejected elsewhere.
- `properties`: used by `object` fields, and by an array's `object`-typed
  `items`.

### `default` and `example`

`default` and `example` are both type- and shape-valid values, but they
encode opposite author intents:

- **`default`** is the value the *majority* of authors want. Because most
  authors want it, the field can be omitted entirely: at render time the
  default fills any field the document leaves out (an
  authored value always wins: `ladder_sourced` in core's
  `quill::compose`). The blueprint renders that concrete default value with a
  type-only annotation. Type-empty defaults (`default: ""`, `[]`, `false`, `0`)
  are the canonical way to mark a "skippable" cell.
- **`example`** matches the semantic and type *shape* of the desired
  value but is *not* the value most authors want. It documents shape, not
  the choice, so it never becomes the rendered value; it takes the cell in the
  blueprint only when no `default:` holds it, and surfaces as a `# e.g.` line
  otherwise.

### The two axes: value and obligation

A field declares two independent things, and neither implies the other.

- The **value** axis is `default:` › `example:` › the field's blank. It decides
  what a cell holds.
- The **obligation** axis is `must_fill:`. It decides whether a human must
  author that cell.

`must_fill:` is `true` / `false`, and when unset it **derives** from the value
axis: a field with a `default:` is not obliged, a field without one is. So a
quill that never writes the key gets the whole obligation surface off `default:`
alone. The derivation reads `default`'s *presence*, so a `default: ""` stays a
skippable cell rather than becoming a marker. The key lives on the field schema,
so it applies at every nesting level.

Declaring it reaches two cells the derivation cannot:

- `must_fill: true` beside a `default:` — a safe value renders, **and** a human
  must still confirm it. Classification markings and effective dates are the
  cases it exists for: the document is never wrong out of the box, and nobody
  ships one nobody looked at. An editor's *confirm* discharges it by writing the
  default's value as authored content: no new state, at the cost that the cell
  then holds that value rather than tracking a later `default:` change.
- `must_fill: false` with no `default:` — genuinely optional, with nothing to
  suggest.

Obligation is a **warning, never a gate**: an unauthored must-fill field
blank-fills and renders, and the signal is the non-fatal
`validation::must_fill` (see [Native validation](#native-validation)). There is
no `required:` axis and no severity knob on this one — severity already *is* the
render-gate signal, so an `Error` that renders fine would break every consumer
routing Error ≡ won't-render. An editor's "can't submit" is consumer policy over
the warning: *a strict consumer treats any outstanding marker as not done*.
A quill author arriving from web forms has the right prior for the affordance
and the wrong one for the enforcement.

On a typed dictionary the container's own `must_fill:` is **inert**: `!must_fill`
is rejected on a mapping, so the obligation lives on the leaves and the
blueprint and the predicate both address them there. An array is its own cell,
including an array of objects.

See [BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md) for how the two axes render into cells.

Identity fields (`name`, `version`, `backend`, `author`, `description`) live on the parent metadata object (Wasm: `Quill.metadata` getter; Python: `Quill.metadata`). Both bindings also expose `backend_id`/`backendId` directly; Python additionally exposes `quill_ref`, a derived `name@version` string.

### Bindings surface

| Binding | Schema accessor |
|---|---|
| Rust | `QuillConfig::schema()` (JSON) / `schema_yaml()` (YAML) |
| Wasm | `Quill.schema` getter (JSON) |
| Python | `Quill.schema` getter (dict) |
| CLI | `quillmark schema <path>` |

### Where the discriminators come from

The schema response omits discriminator fields. Consumers that need to
construct a document derive the discriminators from elsewhere:

- The root block's `$quill` value is `<name>@<version>`, built from
  `quill.metadata.name` and `quill.metadata.version`.
- Each composable card's `$kind` is the key under which it is declared
  in `card_kinds` (e.g. a card listed under `card_kinds.indorsement` is
  written as `$kind: indorsement`).
