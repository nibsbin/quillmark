# Live Preview (WASM)

> **Implementation**: `crates/core/src/`, `crates/backends/typst/src/`, `crates/backends/acroform/src/`, `crates/bindings/wasm/src/`

## TL;DR

The preview surface is two verbs: `render(quill, doc, opts)`, stateless
one-shot bytes for CLI / server / export, and `open(quill, doc)` →
**`LiveSession`**, a persistent, incremental compiler that owns preview. Reads
(`render`, `paint`, `pageSize`, `regions`, `fieldAt`, `positionAt`, `locate`,
`coverage`) serve the session's current compile; `update(doc)` recompiles in place and
returns a `ChangeSet` naming the dirty pages. `paint` writes a rasterized page directly into a
`CanvasRenderingContext2d`; each paint is a **complete** raster: every piece
of page content already visible, so the consumer never composites. It is
multi-backend: every backend rasterizes its pages (Typst, acroform) through one
generic painter.

## Why

Every byte-output format costs per page what canvas costs once: iframed SVG
spends a browser document per page, inline SVG a DOM node per glyph, PNG a zlib
encode and decode plus N decoded bitmaps. The painter writes rasterizer pixels
straight into the backing store, so a consumer keeps memory bounded to the
visible viewport.

The edit loop is the second half of the argument. Re-opening a session per
keystroke rebuilds the whole compilation world (fonts, packages, assets) and
repaints every visible page whether or not it changed. A `LiveSession` keeps
the world alive across edits and reports what an edit visibly changed, so the
per-keystroke cost is *incremental recompile + repaint of `dirty ∩ visible`*.

## The seam

`core` carries a backend-neutral session seam, `SessionHandle`
(`crates/core/src/session.rs`); the WASM painter dispatches through it
generically, never downcasting to a backend session type. Rendering, counting
pages and painting them is what the trait requires: `render`, `page_count`,
`page_size_pt` and `render_rgba` carry no default. Update, geometry and
warnings each carry one, and each of those methods states what a backend
leaving its default costs a consumer.

Canvas is therefore not a capability a session declines. A `SessionHandle`
implementation paints, so `paint`/`pageSize` answer for every page the compile
has, and a `None` from `page_size_pt` or `render_rgba` says one thing: `page`
is past `page_count()`. The throw a binding consumer handles is that
out-of-range one, which a zero-page compile raises on index 0. There is no
capability flag and no pre-session estimate.

## Live edits: `update` and `ChangeSet`

`update(doc)` recompiles the session against a new document, checking its
`$quill` and compiling it through the config the session was opened against.
**Transactional**: on `Err` the previous compile stays live, every read keeps
serving the last-good document and its `warnings`, and the session recovers on
the next successful update. On `Ok` reads serve the new compile: `warnings`
included, and the returned `ChangeSet { page_count, dirty_pages }` names the
pages whose rendered content changed (including added pages; removed pages are
implied by `page_count`). A preview repaints `dirty ∩ visible` and nothing
else: that repaint bound, not compile speed, is the throughput lever.

Per-backend, update is an implementation choice, not a flag:

- **Typst** recompiles incrementally. The session persists its `QuillWorld`
  (fonts, packages, assets parsed once at `open`); an edit swaps the helper
  package's `lib.typ` via `Source::replace` (incremental reparse) and
  recompiles: `comemo` reuses every memoized eval/layout result the edit did
  not reach. Dirty pages come from per-page fingerprints of *visible* frame
  content; introspection `Tag` items are excluded because a page-spanning
  element's tag carries a hash of content on other pages and would dirty
  page 0 on an end-of-document edit.
- **acroform** recompiles fully: its compile is a re-resolve + re-stamp,
  cheap by construction. Dirty pages are those carrying a field whose resolved
  spec changed.

**Cache eviction.** Typst's `comemo` cache is process-global and grows
unboundedly without eviction; an editing loop compiles once per keystroke. The
Typst backend evicts entries older than 10 compiles after *every* compile
(`compile.rs`, matching typst-cli's watch policy): the one-shot path leaks
otherwise too, so eviction is unconditional, not a session feature.

**One session type.** Immutability is an invariant, not a type: reads between
edits see a stable document because update swaps the compile only on success,
and the preview consumer (ours: preview is WASM-only by non-goal) executes
serially. There is no separate
frozen snapshot type and no change-generation counter: with a single owned
consumer there is no cross-edit reader to protect. If a long-lived read-only
viewer ever needs to shed the retained world, a `freeze()` that drops it and
keeps the pageable document is a *mode* to add, not a second type.

`update` is the only edit verb: a whole-document recompile, and it is named apart
from the content lane's `applyChange`, which splices ops into a document rather
than recompiling one. Anchoring a caret
or selection across edits is the **editor's** job: its own transaction mapping
(a ProseMirror / CodeMirror `StepMap`) carries positions through local edits, so
the session holds no change log, no revision stamp, and no per-field delta
path: `FieldRegion` / `ContentHit` carry no `revision`. Geometry
(`regions`, `positionAt`, `locate`) is read against the current compile and
re-read after each committed `update`. `positionAt` (point → content position) and
`locate` (content position → caret rect) are exact inverses over that compile:
that pair *is* the bidirectional preview↔editor cursor bridge, and it needs no
forward-mapping because the editor owns the live position it feeds in.

### Complete-raster contract

`render_rgba` returning `Some` guarantees a **complete** page raster: all
content is visible in the returned pixels and the caller paints them with no
compositing of its own. Backends satisfy it differently:

- **Typst** rasterizes its laid-out page natively (`typst-render` →
  `tiny_skia::Pixmap` → unpremultiply → RGBA8).
- **acroform** rasterizes its stamped PDF via hayro, which draws each
  widget's baked `/AP` appearance stream, so field values appear in the raster
  on their own with no regions-compositing by the caller. The raster is
  stamped at session-open and again at each `update`. It is the stamp `render`
  hands back but for each checkbox's `/AP` `/N`: the deliverable names both
  states there for a filler to toggle, and hayro reads `/N` only as a stream,
  so the raster's `/N` is the one stream its `/AS` selects.

`Ok(None)` is the out-of-range page; the `Err` is a
`scale` no page can be rasterized at. Neither rasterizer bounds the buffer it
sizes from `scale × page size`, so a scale that is not finite and positive, or
that puts a side of the page past `MAX_RASTER_SIDE` (16384 px), is refused
under `backend::invalid_raster_scale` before either is asked. Both size a side
alike, rounded and at least 1 px (core's `raster_size`, which `typst-render`
computes itself and acroform hands hayro, whose own floor reaches 0 px), so the
check counts what is allocated and a tiny scale paints one pixel rather than
none.

`RenderOptions.ppi` meets the same refusal on the byte-artifact path; `paint`
reduces its scale to the ceiling first (`canvas_scale`), since a preview drawn
soft beats one not drawn, where an export at fewer pixels than asked for is a
wrong file. `paint` checks its scale as the `f64` a JS number is, before it
narrows to the rasterizers' `f32`, so a scale past `f32::MAX` is reduced like
any other, and one under `f32::MIN_POSITIVE`, which narrowing would change
rather than round, is refused under the same code.

### Painter owns the canvas

`paint` writes the whole backing store with `put_image_data`, which bypasses
the 2D context transform, `globalAlpha`, and clip. The painter therefore owns
the entire canvas: **give each visible page its own `<canvas>` element.** You
cannot paint two pages into one canvas, paint into a sub-rect, or push a page
through a context transform: the raster is complete precisely so you never
need to composite, and the write ignores context state so you could not if you
tried.

Because every `paint` re-rasterizes from scratch (no per-page raster cache on
the session: a deliberate omission, § Decisions), keep a page's canvas alive
while it stays near the viewport rather than pooling one canvas across pages: an
idle canvas retains its pixels for free, whereas reusing a canvas on scroll
re-runs a full render. This keeps memory bounded to *visible + margin* without
paying re-rasterization on every scroll reversal.

Field geometry is primarily a **session-level query**, `LiveSession::regions()`
(see the region type in `crates/core/src/region.rs`): the interactive-preview
path holds a session and reads geometry off the current compile with no
render: re-read it after each committed `update`. A one-shot byte render
carries the same sidecar only on request (`RenderOptions::regions` → `RenderResult::regions`),
for consumers without a live session: static overlays over an exported SVG,
PDF post-processing, CI coverage probes. The sidecar always describes the
whole document: page indices are document-space even under a `pages` subset
render. Each region carries per-field geometry keyed on the **quill schema
field path** (the address the editor uses) plus, for content ink, the
**content span** it covers (§ Segments and the striped union). Five queries
read it, three coarse and two fine:

- `regions()` answers *field → rectangles* (scroll to / highlight a field),
  one box per content **segment** it draws. `fieldBoxes(field)` derives the
  whole-field highlight from it: one union rect per page over the field's
  `span`-bearing segments, so consumers do not reimplement the union.
- `fieldAt(page, x, y, tolPt?)` answers *point → field* (click → focus in the
  editor), hit-testing the compiled document directly so **every** placement
  resolves, not just the ones `regions()` surfaces.
- `positionAt(page, x, y, tolPt?)` answers *point → content position*: the field
  *and* a USV offset into its `Content`, cluster-exact, for placing a caret
  or mapping a selection into the content model.
- `locate(field, pos)` answers *content position → caret rect*: the reverse of
  `positionAt`, the box to draw a caret at.
- `coverage()` answers *field → reachable?*: every address the compile fills,
  beside the region address a click reaches it through (§ Coverage).

Three producers, each one the plate declares:

- **Generated ink** is tracked by the spans its glyphs carry. A `richtext` or
  `text` value (a body, a card's field, an `[]` element) and every scalar
  or date the plate prints through `qm.ink`
  ([PLATE_DATA.md](PLATE_DATA.md#the-ink-table)) is evaluated at its own
  generated site in the helper, whose byte window the backend records. The
  rendered ink resolves back to its field through *any* placement context: a
  function parameter, a per-card loop variable, a package that rebuilds the
  content (a `show`-rule pass that buffers and re-emits paragraphs). The origin
  rides the glyph, not a marker a rebuild could drop.
- **Marker claims** cover the ink a plate *composes* rather than prints with
  `qm.ink`: a banner keyed on `qm.data.classification`, a package-built address
  block, a computed table. `qm.region(field, body)` brackets `body` with two
  invisible `metadata` markers, and the frame walk claims for `field` every
  piece of ink between them that resolves to no window. It is a **fallback**
  claim, not an override: generated ink and nested claims inside keep their
  own field, so wrapping only ever adds a region. Each *call* claims
  separately, so a wrapper invoked once per card with a `$path`-composed
  address is one region per card.
- **Form-field widgets** carry the path explicitly: acroform from the form
  mapping, a Typst `form-field` from its `field:` argument, both against the
  one address grammar ([PLATE_DATA.md](PLATE_DATA.md#schema-addresses)). A
  widget surfaces a region only when it binds one: a widget with no schema
  field is a backend artifact, not a routable field.

A value the plate prints itself (`#qm.data.subject`,
`text(size: 9pt, qm.data.name)`) carries the plate's span, which names no
field, so it surfaces no region: print it through `qm.ink`, or claim it.

What a claim takes, beyond ink that resolves to no window:

- A detached glyph between its markers is the claim's: text the plate printed,
  such as a `str` cast to content inside a function argument, or a list's
  bullet.
- A detached stroke or image is never the claim's: an underline or strike
  stays with the content field it decorates (§ Decisions).
- Out-of-flow ink is never taken by a claim opened outside it: a page
  marginal (background, header, footer), a footnote, or a float, wherever it
  is anchored. A claim open across a page break takes none of the chrome it
  crosses, the page number, or the notes and floats laid out around its text.
  A claim opened inside, such as a banner in the header or a claim in a
  footnote, takes that ink.
- A page's `foreground` is the exception: Typst lays it out untagged after the
  page's last line of text, so a claim open across that page's break takes it.
  A foreground wrapped in `pdf.artifact` is a marginal like any other.

The marker stack persists across pages so a claim can span a page break, which
leaves a claim whose close marker never reaches a frame bounded by nothing:
those are found before the scan, suppressed in both the region and point
queries, and reported as a `typst::unclosed_region` warning naming the field.

### Coverage

`coverage()` on the session, and core's `coverage(config, data, regions)` over
a one-shot sidecar, list every address the compile fills that a reader could
want to click:

- each declared leaf holding a value that prints, at any depth: anything but
  `null`, an empty string or empty content, so a `0` or `false` is listed;
- a variant container's discriminant;
- every roster member of a matrix, held or not, since the plate prints them all;
- each cell of an item a document adds to an open matrix.

Each carries `coveredBy`: the address itself where a region carries it, else
the nearest enclosing address one does, else nothing. An enclosing address is
coarse (a row claim reaching its cells, a whole array its elements) and is
reported, not hidden: a click there opens more than the field.

The derivation needs no backend seam. A key with a box always accrues its
first one, an unclosed claim accrues nothing in either query, and acroform's
regions are exactly its bound widgets, so the `field` values of `regions()` are
the ones `fieldAt` can return. The one gap is a content field whose only ink
falls between its segments. `quillmark check --regions` prints the report per
document ([CLI.md](CLI.md)); it is a report, not a gate, because a quill may
leave a field unprinted on purpose.

### Segments and the striped union

A content field is not one box. The backend records a per-**segment** source
map (a segment is one paragraph, heading, or whole code fence: the content's
`continues`-joined line run), and `regions()` returns one region per
`(segment, page)`, each carrying `span: [start, end)`: the USV range of the
field's `Content` that box covers. A scalar's or a date's ink, a marker claim,
and a widget carry no `span` (`undefined`): geometry with no content address.

The whole-field highlight is **derived, not emitted**: per `(field, page)`,
union the `span`-bearing segment rects. The union is *striped*: it leaves
inter-paragraph whitespace uncovered, which a single field-level box would
paint over. Emitting a field-level union from the *backend*
would reintroduce the lie the disjointness invariant exists to prevent, so the
union stays out of `regions()`. But the derivation itself is subtle (which
rects carry spans, first-placement-only, widget-vs-content), so a **convenience
owns it** rather than every consumer: `fieldBoxes(field)` (on `LiveSession`,
core `field_boxes(regions, field)` for the one-shot sidecar) folds the
span-filter + per-page union, leaving `regions()` the low-level disjoint truth.
It is content-only: a field placed solely as a scalar's ink, a claim or a
bound widget carries no `span` and yields nothing, its box being a single
`regions()` rect. Equivalent to the union a consumer would write by hand:

```ts
const boxes = session.fieldBoxes(field);        // one union rect per page

// …which is exactly this, per page, now owned by the helper:
const box = regions()
  .filter(r => r.field === field && r.page === page && r.span)
  .reduce(unionRect, undefined);
```

Each `(segment, page)` key surfaces its **first placement**: one region per
page it touches, so highlighting covers continuation pages (page marginals
between one page's body and the next's do not end a placement; a same-page
interruption does), not every placement: span data cannot distinguish
package chrome interrupting one placement from a second placement of the same
value, and a spanning union would claim the ink between them. A marker claim is
exempt from that rule and accrues its whole extent, because `qm.region`
delimits that extent explicitly: an interruption inside a claim is never a
second placement. A field's own
ink *between* its segments (brackets, container-open syntax: usually inkless)
is transparent: it neither accrues a box nor breaks a run. `field` is still
not unique: segment fragments, page fragments, several claims on one field, or
content plus a bound widget each surface independently; consumers group by
`field`. Later placements stay reachable through `fieldAt` / `positionAt`,
where a concrete point identifies one drawn item unambiguously. A blank field
draws nothing and surfaces no region. Geometry only, never a value, and never
needed to complete the picture.

`positionAt` reads the same map the other way: the hit glyph's resolved node
range plus `glyph.span.1` gives an exact generated byte, which inverts through
the owning run's escape scan to a cluster-exact content offset. It is
**cluster-exact, not sub-character**: a hit inside a char that escaped to
several bytes floors to that cluster's first char, and degrades to the
containing segment's start on origin-less ink: a list marker or numbering
(detached-span decoration, attributable to no field: like clicking page
chrome, it resolves to nothing) and, inside a multi-line code fence, every
line sharing one resolved node wider than any per-line run, so per-line
precision collapses to the fence's content start (segment-level correctness
kept). Which of the two happened rides the hit as `granularity`
(`'cluster'` when an owning run resolved the offset, `'segment'` when it floored
to the segment start), so a caret UI trusts a `cluster` offset for the caret
and treats a `segment` one as a segment selection rather than guessing from the
value. `locate` forward-maps a content offset to a generated byte and returns
the covering glyph's box.

**A hit target is the ink, and `tolPt` is what a pointer misses it by.** A
glyph's box is the run's ink height by that glyph's advance, so a text column
answers over a fraction of the area it occupies: horizontally the boxes of one
line abut, but the leading between two lines is inside the paragraph and on no
glyph, and past the end of a short line there is nothing at all. An 11pt
paragraph is live over roughly two thirds of its own height at default leading,
and under half of it double-spaced. Both point queries therefore take a
tolerance: the nearest ink within `tolPt` answers, `0` being exact containment.

**The caller owns the number, because the imprecision is the pointer's.**
Slack is a screen quantity — what a finger or a hand-held mouse
misses by — so a tolerance fixed in points shrinks under the cursor as the page
is drawn smaller, which is where the target is already hardest to hit. A
consumer converts its own slack at the scale it displays the page, CSS px per
point, and passes the result; Quillmark holds no default because it cannot
see that scale.

**Nearest, not a grown box.** The nearest placement within `tolPt` answers,
which keeps the tolerance a pure widening: containment is distance zero, so no
point that resolves exactly ever changes answer as `tolPt` rises. On a tie the
later-painted wins. Widgets and content ink rank in one comparison, a widget
taking a tie: a widget draws no spanned ink of its own, so ink beneath one must
not swallow a click that lands on it.

The slack is a radius in both axes. A click stays on ink some placement drew:
the empty measure beside a short line is as far from that line as a point the
same distance above it, and a point off the text block resolves to nothing.

## TypeScript surface

Capability and rendering live on the **engine** (it holds the resolved
backend); `Quill` is declarative data. Canvas is in the backend builds only.

The declarations are `crates/bindings/wasm/runtime/runtime.d.ts`, which carries
the per-member contract and which `npm run typecheck` holds to the runtime
beside it.

### Regions overlay transform

One origin serves the whole canvas surface: `pageSize`, `regions`, the point
queries, and the raster all measure from the **page's lower-left corner as
drawn**, so `(0, 0)` is the raster's first pixel and `pageSize × scale`
(`paint`'s `scale`, after the clamp) is its extent. A Typst page starts there already. An acroform background's page need
not. The file's own numbers are in PDF user space, and the page a viewer shows
is the **canvas box**, `/CropBox` ∩ `/MediaBox`, which `pdfcrop` leaves
translated away from `(0, 0)`. The backend reports that box's extent as the page
size and subtracts its corner from every region, matching what hayro rasterizes.
The widget `/Rect`s in the PDF the same session renders stay in user space:
canvas geometry is box-relative, the deliverable is not.

One axis flips against that origin and the other does not: a region `rect` is
bottom-left PDF points, a canvas is top-left device pixels. The arithmetic — and
the percentage form an HTML overlay wants instead — is on `FieldRegion.rect` in
`runtime.d.ts`, beside the type it transforms.

## Feature / build mapping

Canvas ships with the render build:

| Build                       | Backends       | Canvas | Notes                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pkg/core/` (no features)   | —              | no     | `Document` + `Quill` only; no engine, no Typst                         |
| `pkg/render/` (`render`)    | typst, acroform | yes    | Typst: native page raster; acroform: hayro raster of the stamped PDF    |

Canvas paint is independent of the output formats a backend emits: acroform
emits PDF alone and paints, because it always links its hayro raster seam.
The wasm `render` feature pulls in `web-sys`, the generic canvas *painter*
(`page_size` / `paint`, dispatching through the core `SessionHandle` seam).
`build-wasm.sh` builds the two artifacts (core, render) sequentially;
`runtime/runtime.js` maps each backend id to the render build with its own
`{ formats }` manifest, drift-guarded per backend by `runtime.test.js`.

## Non-goals

- Native (CLI / Python) exposure. Capability is WASM-only.
- Text selection, find-in-page, accessibility. Canvas has none of these by
  design: if you need them, keep an SVG/PDF export path alongside.
- Click handling in the painter. The painter is a dumb blit; it maps no
  clicks itself. Click→field lives on the **session** (`fieldAt`, hit-testing
  the compiled document): a consumer converts the canvas click to PDF-pt
  page coordinates (the inverse of the [regions overlay
  transform](#regions-overlay-transform)) and asks the session, keeping the
  painter free of interaction state.

## Decisions and rationale

- **Two verbs, one session type.** `render` is the stateless one-shot;
  `open` → `LiveSession` owns preview. The frozen single-compile snapshot is
  not a separate type: its immutability survives as the swap-on-commit
  invariant of a transactional `update`, and its "hold last-good while
  computing next" behavior falls out of the same invariant with no
  special-casing. Third-party preview controllers are out of scope, so no
  defensive snapshot type and no change-generation counter guards a consumer
  we do not ship.
- **One generic painter over the `SessionHandle` seam, not a per-backend
  downcast.** `paint` calls `page_size_pt` / `render_rgba` on the opaque
  session; every backend implements the same two methods, both required.
  Adding a backend is implementing them alongside `render` and `page_count`,
  with no flag to flip and no binding to touch.
- **Preview is part of what a backend is, not a capability it declares.**
  `page_size_pt` and `render_rgba` are required, so a `None` from either says
  one thing: `page` is past `page_count()`. A caller reading it knows it asked
  for a page the compile does not have, and the `paint`/`pageSize` throw on
  that page is the whole gate. A probe cannot replace it: keyed on the backend
  it answers for the backend rather than for the compile, and keyed on output
  formats it answers for the wrong thing entirely, paint being a session seam
  acroform serves while emitting PDF alone. Both shipped backends paint; a
  painterless one would cost a declared flag, and there is nothing to declare
  it for.
- **`update` reports dirty pages, not new handles.** Page identity is the index;
  a `ChangeSet` is data. Nothing borrowed from a previous compile outlives an
  edit because reads resolve against the current compile at call time.
- **A marker claim is a fallback, and ink still belongs to exactly one field.**
  Wrapping content that already resolves to a field could plausibly make the
  region name both. It does not: `fieldAt` and `positionAt` return one field, so
  a two-field region has no answer to give, and `fieldBoxes` would double-count
  it. Innermost wins instead, which is the ordinary scoping intuition and makes
  wrapping purely additive: a `qm.region` takes the ink nothing more specific
  took, and never moves a region off the field that generated it. Retargeting
  ink that is already tracked is therefore not expressible, and deliberately so:
  the wrapper exists for ink with *no* attribution.
- **A claim takes the detached glyphs between its markers, never a detached
  stroke or a marginal.** A `str` cast to content inside a function argument
  carries a detached span, so whether a plate's text is clickable would
  otherwise hang on what it wrapped the value in. A detached `Shape` or
  `Image` stays unclaimed: Typst paints an underline or strike stroke after its
  run's glyphs and inside their box, and `fieldAt` gives a tie to the
  later-painted item, so a claimed stroke would take the click from the content
  field beneath it. Typst wraps each page marginal in an artifact element and
  walks a page's background and header before its body, so inside an artifact
  the walk hides every claim opened outside it: a claim spanning a page break
  would otherwise take the chrome it crosses. A claim opened inside the
  artifact stays open there, so a header can claim its own banner.
- **A footnote or a float is out of flow, like a marginal, not part of the
  claim around its anchor.** Typst lays each one out in a group whose logical
  parent is its anchor, and the walk hides outer claims inside that group as
  it does inside an artifact. Attributing the note to the claim open at its
  anchor, Typst's own reading order, would stretch that claim's one box per
  page from the anchor's line to the page's foot or head, over the text
  between; a plate that wants a note claimed claims it inside the note. The
  anchor reading stays admissible later as a strict addition: a claim inside
  the note is innermost under either. A table cell broken across pages is
  parented to the cell too, and stays in flow.
- **No region is inferred from plate syntax.** A lexical extent is not
  provenance: a window over `rr.map(s => ..)` holds the closure's body, so it
  would outrank every claim inside it, and whether a value regions would hang
  on how the plate spells the read. Attribution comes from what the plate
  declares (generated ink, a claim, a widget), so it does not move when the
  plate is rewritten into an equivalent form. This is not a one-way door: a
  later convenience, such as value-carried provenance or an opt-in scan, is
  admissible only as strictly more precise than a declared producer, and it
  ranks below a claim.
- **Complete raster, never compose-from-regions.** Both backends hand back a
  finished page (Typst natively, acroform by baking each widget's value into the
  `/AP` stream a rasterizer draws). Regions are an overlay sidecar, not a
  compositing input: the painter stays a dumb blit.
- **No session raster cache: re-rasterize per `paint`.** Caching the last
  raster per `(page, scale)` and blitting on scroll-back would skip
  re-rasterizing unchanged pages (`ChangeSet` already names dirty pages to
  invalidate), but it stays unbuilt: the surface ships ahead of its first
  consumer, the megabyte-scale per-page buffers reintroduce the unbounded
  memory the viewport-bounded design set out to avoid, and any `scale`
  change (DPR / zoom) rotates the key and voids the cache. Consumer-side canvas
  liveness (keep the visible page's canvas alive rather than pooling) covers the
  common scroll case without that trade-off; a real consumer's profile is what
  should justify the cache and its eviction policy, not speculation.
- **Method on `LiveSession`, not a sub-handle.** Even with click resolution
  shipped (`fieldAt`), it shares no state with `paint` beyond the compile the
  whole session already owns: a `Preview` sub-handle grouping them is
  ceremony.
- **Not an `OutputFormat`.** Canvas is a side-effecting paint into a JS object,
  not a serializable byte stream. Forcing it into the enum would leak
  `wasm_bindgen` into `core` or make `Artifact` dishonest.
- **Coalesce at the session, not the format.** One compile feeds bytes
  (`render`), pixels (`paint`), and metadata (`pageSize`, `warnings`).
- **One `scale`, backing-store pixels per point, and required.** The
  rasterizer takes one number, so the call does too: display size is the
  consumer's CSS, and how many pixels back it is `devicePixelRatio`, zoom and
  `visualViewport.scale` folded into that number. The painter can see none of
  them, so it takes no default: a guessed 1 is a 72-ppi page, soft on every
  display.
- **Painter owns `canvas.width`/`height`; consumer owns `canvas.style.*`.**
  Folding backing-store math into the painter eliminates a class of "blurry on
  retina" bugs. The ceiling is core's alone, `MAX_RASTER_SIDE`, the canvas side
  every browser admits, so export and paint meet one number and the painter
  holds none of its own. `paint` returns nothing: the backing store it wrote is
  `canvas.width`/`height`, and a canvas styled to fill its box needs no size
  back.
- **Unpremultiplied RGBA on the wire.** Rasterizers produce premultiplied
  alpha; `ImageData` expects non-premultiplied. The backend unpremultiplies
  before handing back the buffer. One allocation per repaint; fine for edit
  cadence.
- **`warnings` accessor on `LiveSession`.** The current compile's non-fatal
  diagnostics (e.g. Typst font fallback): set at open, refreshed by each
  committed `update`, swapped transactionally with the compile. Without the
  accessor they are invisible to canvas consumers (only surfaced via
  `render()`'s `RenderResult`).
- **`regions()` render-free on the session; opt-in on one-shot renders.** The
  invariants are that geometry never composites (the raster is complete
  without it) and that the edit loop reads it without producing bytes: a
  paint-only consumer must never run a throwaway byte render to harvest the
  sidecar. Session exclusivity was never the invariant: there is exactly one
  producer (the frame scan over the current compile), so `RenderOptions::regions`
  attaches the same entries to `RenderResult` for consumers with no session in
  hand (static SVG overlays, PDF post-processing, CI coverage probes, and the
  native bindings, which expose no session surface at all). Off by default:
  exports pay no introspection cost, and best-effort geometry stays a request,
  not a promise attached to every artifact.

## Lifecycle and consumer flow

`open` → `paint` per visible page → `update` on edit →
repaint `dirtyPages ∩ visible`. The [Live Preview](../../docs/integration/live-preview.md)
page is the worked loop.
