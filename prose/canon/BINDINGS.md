# Bindings

> **Implementation**: `crates/bindings/`

## TL;DR

Quillmark exposes one core engine through several language surfaces: Python (PyO3), WebAssembly (wasm-bindgen), and a CLI binary. Every surface drives the same `quillmark` core: the same `Document`/`Quill`/`Card` model, the same `serde` diagnostics, and the same capability principle. Surfaces differ only in language idiom, packaging, and which extras they expose (canvas preview is WASM-only).

## Shared model

- **Capability principle.** A `Quill` is portable, declarative config data. Its format capability (`supportedFormats`) and rendering are resolved by the `Quillmark` engine *against* a quill at render time: never by the quill itself. So `quill.metadata` is a pure, infallible config snapshot — the five identity keys `name`, `version`, `backend`, `author`, `description`, in that order on both surfaces — while `render` / `supportedFormats` can fail for an unregistered backend.
- **One model, serialized across every boundary.** The `Document`/`Card` model and `Diagnostic`s cross each language boundary as the same core `serde` shapes (`CardWire`, the versioned storage DTO, `Diagnostic`), so a card or an error reads identically no matter which surface emits it. See [DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md](DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md), [CARDS.md](CARDS.md), [ERROR.md](ERROR.md).
- **Uniform errors.** Each binding raises a single error type that always carries a non-empty diagnostic list (`QuillmarkError.diagnostics` / thrown `Error.diagnostics`).

The WASM binding is the reference surface; Python mirrors it within its scope (Tier 1 + storage + render; see the scope note below). New contract work lands in WASM first.

## The write surface: object placement over one primitive

Placement decides where a mutation verb lives, in one sentence:

> **If a verb needs a schema, it lives on the writer. `Document` is quill-free data.**

`quill.writer(doc)` (mirroring core's `quill.writer(&mut doc)`) is the one schema-bound door: bare `set` / `set_all` / `reviseBody` / `reviseField` / `reviseDocument` / `addCard` / `removeCard` / `card(i)`, names and markdown in, diagnostics out. It resolves each field's type from the bound quill, so a name the schema does not declare is a typo (`UnknownField`), not a fallback.

`Document` holds everything quill-free: the opaque `store*` primitive (verbatim, coercion deferred to render)
and the addressed content lane: `overwrite` / `revise` / `applyChange`, plus the `importMarkdown` / `exportMarkdown` / `rebase` / `mapPos` / `mapMarks` codec: which navigate by `Addr` and return receipts but never consult a schema.
**Transport** reads (`getStored` / `getExt`) return the stored value verbatim, need no schema, and sit on `Document` too.

The `isInline` / `isPlain` predicates sit beside the codec: `Content::is_inline` / `is_plain`, the `inline` and `plaintext` constraints, over any `Content`. A constraint the schema declares reports through `validation::not_inline` / `not_plain`; one an editor imposes on its own, such as a one-paragraph surface over an `array<richtext>` element, has no diagnostic, so the editor asks the predicate before the leaf commits.

The **interpreting** reads (reading a field by its type) are schema-shaped questions ("this field's richtext, as markdown"), so they gain a schema-bound home: `quill.reader(doc)`, the read twin of `quill.writer(doc)` (mirroring core's `quill.reader(&doc)`).

`reader.get(addr)` reads each field in the values form: every content leaf in its type tree to its codec's text (a `richtext` leaf to markdown, a `plaintext` leaf to its literal text, marks verbatim), everything else as stored, a present-null as `null`: with schema authority, so a name the schema does not declare throws `UnknownField` instead of reading back `undefined`, and a content leaf holding an undecodable value throws `FieldDecode`.

`reader.getContent` is the same read at the other end of the codec, returning the **`Content`** rather than the projection: it makes a content field's storage form an implementation detail instead of a caller's branch, and it still spans the transport door's as-authored rest.

**The bound door is the primary ingestion path.** `quill.parse(md)` is parse-then-conform, and `quill.conform(doc)` is the same walk on a document that arrived any other way; both live on the quill because both need the schema. A document that came through either rests at its canonical form, one per codec ([SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md) § "Content fields rest per codec"): a `richtext` field as the `Content` object, a `plaintext` field as its literal string, so `getStored` answers "content object or string?" by the field's declared codec rather than by how the document was built.

The schema-free `Document.fromMarkdown` remains the transport/repair door (migrations, `$ext` stamping, a quill that will not load, opening a document to fix its `$quill`); the resting form of what it returns is unspecified, and the next bound load converges it.

Across the content fields the walk covers, the exception states are named, never silent: no quill means as-authored rest, the wrong quill throws before any mutation, and a content-field value the strict write refuses stays authored under a `conform::*` warning.

A field whose type tree bears no content leaf is outside the walk, so conform is silent about it by construction: a scalar's shorthands are the typed write's to canonicalize, and a stored value its grammar refuses (a wall clock in a `date`) is `quill.validate`'s to report. A clean conform says the content fields are at rest, not that every field would commit.

Decoding needs the schema and not the payload: a `richtext` string is markdown and a `plaintext` string is literal text, so the same stored bytes decode two ways and only the declared type says which. That is why the `Content` read binds the quill instead of sitting beside `getStored`: a quill-free version would guess a codec, and would guess markdown.

**A `Content`-typed read is also a write input, so it answers in the one canonical form.** That form omits a zero `Container.instance`, since a row written before the field existed then re-encodes byte for byte ([DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md](DOCUMENT_STORAGE.md) § "Container identity"). Every lane carries it: `reader.getContent{,At}`, `getStored` on a body, `importMarkdown`, `rebase`, and the `Card` wire behind `document.main` / `cards` / `card(i)` / `removeCard` / `seedMain` / `seedCard`. `getStored` on a field and `payloadItems` carry the same form, echoed unread, which is why both are typed `unknown`.

`instance` is therefore optional on the read type, and a write takes either spelling. Required would not have bought correctness anyway: a checker reports a container that omits the field; it cannot report a `0` stamped on every run, which is the write that welds them. `assignInstances` is the rule, not the type.

A field's markdown lives here: `Document.bodyMarkdown` is **body-only** (it takes a `CardAddr`; a present `field` throws), and the quill-free **body** projection stays on `Document` (a body's type is a format fact, not a schema fact, so `reader.bodyMarkdown` mirrors it rather than gating it on the schema). One name for one projection, on every surface: core's `Card::body_markdown`, `doc.bodyMarkdown`, `reader.bodyMarkdown`. The placement rule generalizes: *a verb that needs a schema lives on the writer (writes) or the view (reads); `Document` is quill-free data.*

The rule scales from a field to a card without a new receiver: `reader.card(i)` / `writer.card(i)` carry the same verbs one slot in, and `reader.resolve()` is the render view over the whole document, beside the authored read `get` answers ([SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md) § "The values form"). `quill.parse` / `quill.validate` / `quill.conform` stay on the quill as its ingestion and verdict verbs: a constructor, a diagnostic list, and `parse`'s in-place twin, none of them a read or write of a value.

`reviseField` is the writer verb that is both typed *and* anchor-preserving: it rebases surviving anchors like the content `revise`, then conforms the diffed result to the field schema like `set`. Because it needs the schema, it lives on the writer: wrapping core's `Card::revise_field_checked` primitive, which `Document` does not expose.

**The writer is the only typed door, core included.** The typed primitives (`Card::commit_field`, `Card::revise_field_checked`) are `#[doc(hidden)]`. A resolved `FieldSchema` argument is the only thing that tells them from their opaque and schema-blind neighbours, and disambiguating by argument is a third mechanism beside the receiver and the verb: one the rule below does not name and a caller cannot see.

**The verb carries the lane.** One vocabulary rule, stated once here:

| Verb | Lane | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **store** | verbatim | the quill-free opaque write; coercion deferred to render |
| **set** | typed | the writer's strict commit at the write. `set` writes one field and `set_all` merges a batch, at card or document scope |
| **overwrite** · **revise** · **apply** | content | identity-aware, and a ladder by **anchor fate** |

The content lane's three verbs are rungs, and what sorts them is the fate of the identity anchors already on the value:

- **overwrite** *destroys* them. Value semantics: store exactly this content, no import, no diff.
  A `toMarkdown → overwrite` round-trip cannot resurrect an anchor, which is why the cold-import path is spelled `overwrite(addr, importMarkdown(md).content)` at the call site, where the loss is visible, and the import's `warnings` sit beside the `.content` it takes.
- **revise** *rebases* them. Import the markdown, diff against the current value, carry surviving anchors onto the new text, and hand back the `Revised` receipt:
  the `delta`, and a `parse::dropped_construct` warning per construct the import dropped ([ERROR.md](ERROR.md) § "Warning flow"), its `path` the address written wherever the caller knows it.
  The writer's `reviseDocument` is the same rung over a whole document. Cards carry no id, so it aligns the incoming composable cards to the stored ones by a diff over their `$kind` sequences, a run of one kind paired by text similarity, an unchanged card paired with its twin wherever it moved, and the cards no text pairs paired in order by kind within each gap the text pairs leave. Each aligned body and content field revises; a prose anchor on an unaligned card, or one a diff drops, drops, and the `DocumentRevised` receipt names each one.
- **apply** *preserves* them. Splice ops into the content in place; anchors and island ids ride the splice because the text around them is what moved.

**The rebase rule.** Every channel that moves text (`delta`, `islandOps`, `lineOps`) rebases the marks already in the field by one assoc rule, and `revise` carries surviving anchors by the same biases:

| mark edge | assoc | an insertion at that exact position |
|---|---|---|
| a range's `start` | `after` | grows text outside the span |
| a range's `end` | `before` | grows text outside the span |
| a zero-width mark | `before` | leaves the mark put |

The last row is the only position where the two assocs differ, and where an anchor most often sits.

`markOps` are written in the coordinates that rebase produces. Left as prose, the rule is a prediction every editor bridge reimplements to decide which ops to emit; `mapMarks(content, bundle)` runs it instead, and a bridge diffs its intended marks against what it returns. Both readings walk one channel list (`Content::apply_text_channels`) and normalize, so the store and the prediction cannot answer a position differently, nor hold a different set of marks where a move left two same-kind runs touching.

**The rule governs user-field writes.** System metadata (`store_ext` / `store_seed_*`), structural operations (`insertCard` / `moveCard`), and the `remove_*` family sit outside it: `remove_*` has no lane because one verb serves every write path, and a structural op moves cards rather than writing into one. So `store_field` / `store_fields` are the opaque store, `set` / `set_all` the typed writer, and a name never needs per-verb disambiguation against its neighbor (the opaque batch `store_fields` and the typed batch `set_all` are not near-homographs).

**Why the verb carries it when a receiver could.** Where a receiver exists it names the lane too (`doc.storeField` vs `writer.set`), so the verb looks redundant. It is not, on a design choice rather than a law: the reference surface (WASM `Document`) **flattens all three lanes onto one class**, and the parity table below requires a binding verb be identical to its core twin. A verb leaning on its receiver would need a different spelling on the flattened surface, and the table would have to admit a fourth difference class to hold it. Change the flattening and this rule loses its load.

The body verbs follow from the same rule rather than from a separate one. `writer.reviseBody` is the content lane's `revise` reached through the writer: a body carries no field schema, so there is nothing for a typed verb to type, and the receipt it returns is the content lane's, not a typed lane's. The typed writer holds it because that is where a caller already is, not because the write is typed.

**The read side mirrors it.** The verbatim read is `getStored`: the read echo of `store`, and the interpreted read is `reader.get`, the reader/writer twin of `set`. So the transport and schema-plane reads carry the lane in the verb the same way the writes do, rather than collapsing both onto one `get` where only the receiver (`doc` vs `reader`) tells them apart. (Core needs no such split: its verbatim read is the map-idiomatic `payload().get`, already lexically distinct from `reader.get`; the collision is a WASM/pyo3 artifact of fusing the read onto the one `Document` handle, so only the bindings rename it.)

**`equals` is the change gate.** A consumer driving a live preview gates `update` on structural equality against a retained clone: `if (doc.equals(last)) return; last = doc.clone()`. It covers the document the consumer did not mutate itself: one swapped in from storage, or written through a writer held elsewhere. `toStored` is byte-deterministic within a schema version, for a consumer that prefers a hashed gate.

**No revision counter.** Neither `Document` nor the session carries one ([PREVIEW.md](PREVIEW.md)). Equality answers whether this is the content last compiled. A counter answers only whether something was written, so it re-applies on a load that is content-identical to the live compile. `main_mut` / `card_mut` hand out a `CardMut`, which is a place a bump could sit — the decision rests on what the counter would answer, not on where it could be stamped.

**Writers and card cursors are ephemeral: bind, write, discard.** They hold an address (the quill + document, or an index), never a cache; every call reads through the document, so a `removeCard` / `addCard` between binding a cursor and writing through it silently retargets it. A caller whose cards move re-resolves the index at write time ([PROGRAMMATIC.md](PROGRAMMATIC.md)).

**The hand-written runtime is the real API; the wasm class is its ABI.** The quill-taking `_commitField` / `_commitFields` / `_addCard` / `_reviseField` methods are the stable ABI under the writer's `set` / `set_all` / `addCard` / `reviseField`: underscored and dropped from the `.d.ts`, not from the binary. The visible `Document` class then carries zero quill-taking methods, so the split is structural, not asserted.

### Parity table

Every binding verb is *identical* to its core twin or names its one forced difference: **FFI** (a wasm-bindgen / pyo3 constraint), **idiom** (a language ergonomic), or **scope** (a lane a binding omits by intent: Python is Tier 1 + storage + render), nothing else admitted.

**Identical to their core twins**, so the table below omits them, each binding spelling them in its own case: `set` / `set_all`, `add_card` (make, typed commit and insert fused into one transactional call; `at` appends when absent, else inserts at the index), `remove_card`, and `conform` (in place, returning the `conform::*` diagnostics; Python's are the dicts `validate` answers with). Two more are identical where they exist, both WASM-only: the `writer.card(i).kind` cursor read, and `session.update`, a whole-document recompile distinct from the content lane's `applyChange` splice. The table holds one row per forced difference.

| Concept | Core | Bindings | Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Typed writer front door | `quill.writer(&mut doc)` | `quill.writer(doc)` | **idiom**: core holds `&mut Document` under the checker; the bindings re-borrow per call (pyo3/wasm objects carry no lifetime), so the guarantee becomes the ephemerality convention |
| Typed reader front door | `quill.reader(&doc)` | `quill.reader(doc)` | **idiom**: the read twin; same re-borrow/ephemerality as the writer |
| Interpreted read | `reader.get(name)?` → `Option<QuillValue>`; `reader.card(i)?.get(..)?` | `reader.get(addr)` / `reader.card(i).get(name)` (JS), `reader.get(name, card=i)` (py) | **idiom** / **FFI**: the values form above, reached through an `Addr` or a `card=` selector. An absent field reads `undefined` / `None` and a present-null reads `null` / `None`, so Python cannot tell the two apart |
| Interpreted `Content` read | `reader.get_content(name)?` → `Option<Normalized>`; `reader.card(i)?.get_content(..)?` | `reader.getContent(addr)` / `reader.card(i).getContent(name)` (JS), `reader.get_content(name, card=i)` (py) | **idiom** / **FFI**: a declared type that is not a content leaf is `FieldNotContent` (an `array<richtext>` carries content and still has no one `Content`). Both bindings return canonical Content-JSON; in JS the absent-field addr reads the body's `Content` |
| Nested `Content` read | `reader.get_content_at(name, path)?`; `reader.card(i)?.get_content_at(..)?` | `reader.getContentAt(addr, path)` / `reader.card(i).getContentAt(name, path)` (JS), `reader.get_content_at(name, path, card=i)` (py) | **idiom** / **FFI**: the same read one axis in, `path` a `PathStep[]` / `Sequence[str \| int]` walked through the field schema's `items` / `properties` / `variants` to the leaf whose declared type names the codec; the empty path *is* `get_content`. A path naming nothing stored reads absent, the field axis's totality applied to the axis a repeater mutates; a bad card index still throws. The path is the read's own argument rather than an `Addr` member, since `storeField` / `getStored` / `applyChange` take an `Addr` and cannot answer an element axis |
| Resolved view | `reader.resolve()` → `Resolved` (over the `Quill::resolve` producer) | `reader.resolve()` (JS) | **scope**: the render view beside the authored `get`; WASM-only until a Python consumer names a call site |
| Body revise | `writer.revise_body(md)?` → `Revised { delta, warnings }` | `writer.reviseBody(md)` (JS), `writer.revise_body(md)` (py) | **scope**: the content lane's `revise` reached through the writer, since a body has no field schema to type against; the warnings anchor at the body. JS returns `{ delta, warnings }`; Python returns the warnings and discards the `Delta`, as on `revise_field` |
| Typed content field revise | `TypedWriter::revise_field(name, md)?` / `CardWriter::revise_field(..)?` | `writer.reviseField(name, md)` / `writer.card(i).reviseField(..)` (JS); `writer.revise_field(name, md, card=i)` (py) | **idiom**: typed *and* anchor-preserving; both wrap `Card::revise_field_checked`, and the writer anchors the receipt's warnings at the field. JS returns `{ delta, warnings }`; Python returns the warnings and discards the `Delta` (the position-mapping receipt is an editor concern, WASM-only) |
| Typed whole-document revise | `TypedWriter::revise_document(md)?` → `DocumentRevised { dropped_anchors, warnings }`, over the quill-free `Document::revise(md)?` | `writer.reviseDocument(md)` (JS), `writer.revise_document(md)` (py) | **idiom**: `Document::revise`, then conform, so a door holding the quill keeps parse-then-conform; no binding exposes the quill-free revise. A `$quill` this quill does not answer to throws before any mutation, as `quill.parse` does. JS returns `{ droppedAnchors, warnings }`, each `path` a `DocPath` string; Python returns the warnings and discards the rest, as on `revise_body` |
| Annotated read | `Document::to_markdown_annotated()` → `AnnotatedMarkdown { markdown, anchors }` | `doc.toAnnotatedMarkdown()` (JS) | **scope**: a quill-free `Document` read, WASM-only until a Python consumer names a call site. JS returns `{ markdown, anchors: { id, path, line }[] }`, each `path` a `DocPath` string. Written back through `writer.reviseDocument`, the read keeps what `toMarkdown`'s keeps: the import drops each tag |
| Card insertion | `push_card(card)` / `insert_card(i, card)` | `insertCard(card, at?)` | **idiom**: the binding folds core's append + positional-insert verbs into one; absent `at` appends |
| Card cursor | `writer.card(i)?` (eager check) | `writer.card(i)` (lazy check, JS) | **FFI** / **scope**: no borrow to validate against, so the index is checked at the write; WASM-only, where the writer holds the document by reference — Python addresses a card with the `card=` selector each verb takes |
| Reads (value / body markdown / `$ext`) | `body_markdown(..)` / `payload().get(..)` / `card.ext()` (borrow chain; index for a card) | `doc.getStored(addr?)` / `doc.bodyMarkdown(cardAddr?)` / `doc.getExt(cardAddr?)` (JS) | **idiom** / **FFI** / **scope**: WASM fuses the transport reads onto the one `Addr` (a bare string ⇒ `{field}` for `getStored`), and they are *total over the field axis*: an absent field reads `undefined`, and only an out-of-range card throws. Python has no quill-free field read: interpreted field reads go through `quill.reader(doc).get`, and `$ext` / body content read off the `main` / `cards` dict snapshots |
| Reads (whole card / seed) | `card(i)` / `main().seed()` | `doc.card(i)` / `doc.seedOverlay(kind)` (JS), `doc.card(i)` / `doc.seed_overlay(kind)` (py) | **idiom**: both bindings fuse each into one named verb on `Document`, quill-free structure reads that spare the caller the whole-`cards` / whole-`main` projection; `card(i)` throws out of range, the seed read is total (no such kind → `undefined`/`None`) |
| Path mint (address → anchor) | `DocPath::main()` / `DocPath::card(kind, i)` extended by `field` / `body` | `doc.pathFor(addr)` / `doc.cardPath(i)` (JS) | **scope**: the `Addr` rendered as the `DocPath` string `Diagnostic.path` carries and the geometry queries take, so a consumer never restates the kind lookup, the `Addr` defaults or the range guard; quill-free (the stored `$kind` verbatim) and *total on the index axis*, unlike the `Addr` reads: a path is an anchor, not a read, so an out-of-range card mints the `cards[<i>]` root the error itself anchors at. WASM-only: Python has no `Addr` and exports no path parser or serializer, so there is no gap to close |
| Content revise (content lane) | `Card::revise_field(name, md)?` (schema-blind, borrow chain) | `doc.revise({card, field}, md)` (addr literal, JS) | **FFI** / **scope**: same model, flattened navigation, schema-blind; WASM-only. Core's `Card` verb returns `Revised` with unanchored warnings, since a card does not know its address; `doc.revise` anchors them at `addr` and returns `{ delta, warnings }`. Python's anchor-preserving write is the typed `writer.revise_field` |
| Content overwrite / splice (content lane) | `Card::overwrite_body(rt)` / `Card::overwrite_field(name, rt)?` / `Card::apply_body_change(b)?` / `Card::apply_field_change(name, b)?` | `doc.overwrite(addr, rt)` / `doc.applyChange(addr, bundle)` (JS) | **FFI** / **scope**: WASM fuses each body/field pair onto one `Addr` verb; WASM-only. The other two rungs of the anchor-fate ladder above |
| Opaque store | `store_field` / `store_fields` | `storeField` / `storeFields` (JS, `Addr`) | **scope**: the quill-free verbatim write, WASM-only; Python has no opaque field store (the typed writer is the only field write). A field write without a loadable quill operates on the storage DTO directly |
| Parse + warnings | `Document::parse(md) -> Parsed { document, warnings }` | `Document.fromMarkdown(md)` → `doc.warnings` getter | **FFI**, the wrapper fuses `Parsed` + `Document` into one session object: `fromMarkdown` returns the document directly and stashes the parse `warnings` on it (`doc.warnings`), each body's `parse::dropped_construct` among them; a field's markdown string reports none here, since no schema says which field is `richtext`, and reports from `quill.parse`'s conform or `quill.validate(doc)`. That getter is a deliberate asymmetry with core, where warnings live only on `Parsed`: it is session state, so `equals` and the storage DTO exclude it and `loadStored`/`fromStored` and the writer's `reviseDocument` clear it (a reloaded or revised document carries no parse warnings) |
| Bound parse (the primary ingestion path) | `quill.parse(md) -> Parsed` | `quill.parse(md)` (JS), `quill.parse(md)` (py) | **FFI**: same `Parsed`-fusing wrapper as `fromMarkdown`, so parse warnings *and* the conform's warnings, a `richtext` field's `parse::dropped_construct` among them, ride the one `doc.warnings` carrier. A `$quill` naming a different quill throws (core: the `BoundParseError` mismatch half) rather than conforming under the wrong schema |
| Render date | `today: CalendarDate` on `Quillmark::open` / `Quillmark::render` / `Quill::resolve` / `reader.resolve` | an optional trailing `today` on `engine.open` / `engine.render` / `reader.resolve` (JS, `YYYY-MM-DD`), `engine.render(.., today=)` (py, a `datetime.date`); omitted, the host's local date | **idiom**: a binding is the host, so it supplies the local date core never reads ([SCHEMAS.md](SCHEMAS.md#the-render-date-today)) |
| Engine backend roster | `engine.registered_backends()` | `engine.registered_backends()` (py) | **scope**: Python only. WASM settles the same question at build time: `build-wasm.sh` emits a Typst-free `core` variant alongside the default one, so which backends exist is a property of the artifact a consumer imported, not a runtime read |

The single **idiom** row on the front door is the honest cost: the typed writer is the one shape pyo3 carries worst, so its "identical" is qualified, not claimed.

## Python: `bindings/quillmark-python`

PyO3 bindings published as `quillmark` on PyPI. A `snake_case` surface over the shared model; one-shot `engine.render` (no canvas).

> **Scope: Tier 1 + storage + render.** Field I/O flows through `quill.writer(doc)` / `quill.reader(doc)` exclusively; `Document` is quill-free data and structure (parse, the storage DTO, `insert_card` / `remove_card` / `move_card`, `remove_field`, the `card` / `seed_overlay` reads, `$ext` / `$seed`).
>
> The opaque store (`store_field` / `store_fields`) and the anchor-preserving content lane (`overwrite` / `revise` / `apply_change` + the `import_markdown` / `export_markdown` / `rebase` / `map_pos` / `map_marks` codec) are **WASM-only by scope, not by lag**: their audience, storage/migration tooling holding no quill and live editors preserving anchor identity, is not a Python audience. A field write without a loadable quill operates on the storage DTO directly. The annotated read (`toAnnotatedMarkdown`) waits on a Python consumer.

Every Python verb is identical to its core/WASM twin or names its one difference in the parity table above:
`card=None` selectors fold every composable-card twin onto one axis — the `Writer` / `Reader` verbs, `$ext`, `remove_field` — and `revise_body` / `revise_field` / `revise_document` return the receipt's warnings and discard the rest (an editor receipt). No half-mirrored lane remains to drift.

**The surface is typed.** pyo3 docstrings are runtime-only, so the wheel ships a `py.typed` marker beside a hand-written `_quillmark.pyi`: without them every class resolves to `Any`. The stub is signatures only, the prose staying in `src/`, and nothing gates the two together: unlike WASM's `runtime.d.ts`, which CI typechecks against the generated backend declarations, a Python verb can be added or resignatured without the stub following. `python -m mypy.stubtest --ignore-disjoint-bases quillmark` is the check to run by hand when it changes.

## WebAssembly: `bindings/quillmark-wasm`

wasm-bindgen bindings published as `@quillmark/wasm`. Builds with `--target web` and `--weak-refs` so wasm-bindgen handles are reclaimed by `FinalizationRegistry`; `.free()` remains as the eager teardown hook. Requires Node 24+ / current evergreen browsers.

**The runtime owns instantiation.** `--target web` emits no `.wasm` ESM import and no top-level await, so nothing in the package graph forces a bundler plugin and a static import of `@quillmark/wasm` is safe anywhere, SSR included. The cost is that instantiation becomes explicit: `const { Quill, Document } = await init()` before the sync surface is touched.

- **Core only.** `Engine` instantiates each backend itself, inside the lazy load, so a consumer initializes core and nothing else.
- **Memoized on the promise**, so several entry points may each await it for one instantiation: the pattern is a destructure at the top of every entry point, not one trusted startup site.
- **Both failure codes reject**, `runtime::init_conflict` included, keeping the delivery rule in [ERROR.md](ERROR.md) § "Bindings Error Delegation" true at the one export that could break it.
- **One contract everywhere.** The binary streams from a URL in a browser and is read off disk under Node, resolved through the `#quillmark-env` subpath import rather than a runtime `typeof process` branch.

The `--target bundler` alternative emits `import * as wasm from "./wasm_bg.wasm"`, which no browser and no bundler resolves natively; the plugin that fixes it rewrites the import to a top-level await, and because the runtime statically imports core, that await lands on every consumer's static module graph. `build-wasm.sh` asserts the built artifacts carry neither form.

**The gate is the only door, so a pre-init call is unwritable.** `init` resolves to the core surface — the core build's values, which are exactly what its instance stands behind — and the runtime layer exports none of them statically, so a handle cannot be obtained without having awaited. With one entry in the `exports` map there is no subpath around it either. This is what makes the precondition structural instead of a convention a consumer has to know. A floating `init()` is an ESLint rule rather than a `tsc` diagnostic, so a signature is no guard, and a load order that reaches an initialized runtime by luck passes in dev and in the test that covers it.

Everything needing no instance stays a static export, unawaited: `MAIN_CARD_ADDR`, `VARIANT_DISCRIMINANT_KEY`, `assignInstances`, `isQuillmarkError`. So do `Engine`, `LiveSession` and the four writer/reader classes, which their **arguments** gate rather than the door — every `Engine` verb takes a `Quill` first, and the writer/reader constructors take both handles, so a caller who has not awaited cannot produce an argument to call them with. Holding them out of the gate keeps them tree-shakable, so the editor path drops the dispatcher it never calls.

The two constructors taking no handle reach no wasm: `new Engine()` validates a descriptor map, and a `LiveSession` forwards to the backend session `engine.open` is the sole source of. None of the six carries a static method, the one member shape an argument cannot gate. `gate.test.js` is the executable guard, driving the whole static surface before `init`.

Ships **multiple artifacts from one crate** behind a single public root export. The root `@quillmark/wasm` is a hand-written **canonical runtime layer** that hands out the internal Typst-less **core** build's `Document` + `Quill` (load / validate / schema / seed / blueprint) verbatim and adds an `Engine` render dispatcher.

The **render** build, carrying both backends (Typst and acroform), is a **private** build with its own linear memory, lazily loaded on the first render or `engine.load(quill)`: there is no public `/core` or `/render` subpath. Core is small and eager; the render build is megabytes (Typst dominates) and loads only when something asks for it. `load` exists so a host can start that fetch without a document: `open` snapshots the document before it awaits the load, so a session opened mid-load compiles a stale one. `scripts/build-wasm.sh` enforces core's gzip ceiling, failing the build when Typst leaks back into the no-features build.

Backend handles never escape the `Engine`: it clones the quill tree + `doc.toStored()` into the backend's memory as serialized data and frees the clones.

The storage DTO carries no warnings, so the clone the backend renders knows nothing of the load's, and `Engine.render` returns the backend render's own: `quill.validate`'s warnings but `backend::declined_construct`, then the compile's, which carry that decline ([ERROR.md](ERROR.md) § "Warning flow"). The load's stay on `doc.warnings`. `LiveSession.render` carries the compile's alone.

**An options object refuses a key it does not read.** Its reader looks up the names it declares and never visits the rest (`serde_wasm_bindgen` ignores `deny_unknown_fields`), so a misspelled option would read as absent and the call go ahead on its default: `engine.render(quill, doc, { today })` would render the local date. `RenderOptions`, on both render verbs, and `EngineOptions` throw on such a key instead, as an `Addr` and a `CardInput` do, through one key walk per layer (`reject_unknown_keys` in the binding, `rejectUnknownKeys` in the runtime).

The reader also reaches a non-enumerable key and one up the prototype chain, so the walk reads every own name, a key holding `undefined` included. It takes only a plain object, one whose prototype is `null` or has a `null` prototype itself, as `Object.prototype` of any realm does: a `Map`, a class instance and `Object.create({ … })` throw. That prototype may be a null-prototype object of defaults, so the walk reads its own names too, but those `Object.prototype` holds. The refusal carries no code: it is a call site to fix, not a condition to route on.

A payload item, the `storeFields` fields object, and a `$ext` or `$seed` value are read whole rather than by declared name, so they see own enumerable keys alone: a non-enumerable or inherited key there is neither read nor refused.

**Exactly one copy of the package per process.** Two copies are two core builds (two linear memories, two `Quill`/`Document` classes), and no topology legitimately loads a multi-megabyte binary twice and needs handles to cross between the copies. Every seam taking a core handle checks it and throws a `QuillmarkError` naming the duplicate install, including the ones that could cross as data (`Engine`, `LiveSession.update`). Errors are the exception: `isQuillmarkError` stays structural, an error being data rather than a handle.

Beyond the byte-output verbs (`engine.render`, `LiveSession.render`), the render build exposes a **live preview** path on `LiveSession` for both backends (`update`, `pageCount`, `pageSize`, `paint`, …), canvas paint being required of the session seam rather than declared.
